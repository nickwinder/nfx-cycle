            <p>We started the week by travelling from the snow in Takayama to relative warmth of Nagoya. It’s amazing how 90 miles can make a difference. We were heading for our first couch surfing host of Japan, obviously a little apprehensive to see who we would be residing with.  We managed to fight our way through the crowd’s, somehow jump on the correct trains (there were lines for different trains on a single platform!) and got to Daidocho station and we had a super happy face to meet us. It turn out our host was as friendly as friendly could be and really welcoming.</p>

<p>As soon as we got to his flat he told us that he was heading to his martial arts lesson and ask if we wanted to come along and watch.  Of course it was a yes, we wanted to see ninjas. It turned out to be pretty western with the master being from California, but still a fun experience and then ending with a trip to our first sushi train. This was nothing like the western ones, you could order from a screen or pick up a plate from the train. Order plates came out on a super speed belt, it resembles their train systems really. The was a plate deposit slot, and when you put 5 plates in, a little cartoon game played and a plastic ball popped out a channel above the table with a little gift.  It had one of the rubber discs which you turn inside out, put it on a table and it flies in the air. So this is what to expect for dinner in Japan, not quite a simple roast at the pub.

<p>The next day was valentines day and what better way to spend it than to walk 20 miles.  We headed out to an old style post town called Magome in the Kiso valley.  Most of the town still had the old style wooden housing, it was a little bit of a tourist trap but nice to see how things used to be. But this wasn’t enough for us we decided to talk a walk over the hills to a volunteer tea house.  The tea house was here to serve a major hiking route through the kiso valley, linking lots of the old post towns through the area. The only thing deterring was the multiple bear beware signs, but I decided it was winter, they’ll be mostly sleeping. We arrived at a large old building by it’s self at the bottom of a slippy snowy walk to find an old man inviting us in. He dried some sweet potato on top of the stove and served us some nice warm green tea.

<p>We headed back over to Magome and decided to keep following the route towards a larger town called Nakatsugawa as there was a old castle ruins just on the other side of the town. This sound unusual for Japan as either most the castles have been rebuilt or long since gone. It ended up being quite a long route and mostly on small lanes.  The villages seemed much like you would find anywhere in the world really.  Farm like houses which could do with a bit of love and their own veggie patches on the side.  After a really steep switch back climb we got over to castle fair late on, but it was well worth it. A lot of the foundations are still there and the views at the top looked over the whole valley.

<p>After getting out of Nagoya on the first day, we decided it was a good idea to stay and see what the city had to offer.  We headed for a shopping arcade that was popular for a slightly alternative crowd. Think crazy second hand clothes, love of anime and anything electronic. It was pretty interesting and cool to see. We’d not seen to much of this in other cities, and the arcades were crazy to us.  Other than that, we headed to the more effluent area of Nagoya which had some nicer architecture and another slight change from the Japan we’d seen up to now.

<p>Next we had our first quick stop in Kyoto. This is supposed to be one of the most beautiful places in Japan, mainly due to the fact that they still have a lot of the older buildings, which were not bombed during the war.  We were staying with another couch surfer, this time in slightly different conditions. A small 1.5 room flat, a bunk bed, with 4 of us sleeping in the place. Just a little weird the first night, as another Korean lad had to sleep in the single bed with the host.  Maybe he’s offering his place out a little too much. We visit a few places, but tried to save most of the famous sights for our second visit, so expect more next week.
Oh but we did find a brewery. That’s always nice.

<p>So more Kyoto next week, but first a bit of Kobe. We do not know too much about the place apart from it’s famous for steak, it’s a port town. That’s it. We’ll see.</p>
