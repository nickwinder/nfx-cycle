            <p>Melbourne was a quick stop for us on the way to Japan. Flights from Melbourne seemed to be much cheaper than flying from anywhere in NZ, so we decided to catch a quick flight over there for our flight to Japan.</p>

<p>We were got into Melbourne fairly late, so as we’re a little cheapo, we decided to have a little over night stay in the airport, instead of wasting our money on a hotel.  It proved to be a pretty bad nights sleep, but nothing more than could be expected. It also prompted us to get moving early the next morning.</p>

<p>The first thing to do when in Melbourne. Head for a coffee of course. We stopped into a nice little coffee shop with a great selection, it certainly took the edge of the airport sleep.  A quick stop by the airbnb to check in and we were out again to start exploring. We grab a little bit of food and headed for the beach, St Kilda is a famous area Melbourne which everyone visits as the beach runs straight into the city suburbs. It creates a buzzing scene and a great hangout spot. After this we headed back into town as we decided to walk through the busy alleyways and bustling arcades. To our amazement we food and all you can eat vege curry for $6.50, that is certainly a offer you can’t refuse. It wasn’t half bad either. But on with our little tour, we got to the graffiti streets, which held some amazing street art. I’d say the only disappointing part of it is the idiots that decide it’s ok to tag over some great pieces.  After all this we were tired, we headed back to the airbnb for an early one.

<p>Day 2. The next day we were meeting up with Ashley’s friends to go to a winery out of town.  Obviously we had a coffee before this, but enough about that. We had a bite to eat at the winery and I tried to act posh ordering a Riesling, it was alright I suppose. There was a little sculpture park to look round, we all had fun deciding what on earth they all were supposed to be.  After this we headed to the highest point in the local area. 350m can you believe. It did have great views of Melbourne in the distance though.  It was a good day out of the city and nice to see Ashley’s friends. We had a bite to eat back in Melbourne, a nice cheap Asian treat for us again and a few beers with the airbnb host to end the night.</p>

<p>Day 3. This was the final day in Melbourne as we’d be flying out in the evening, but we were not going to waste it.  The sun was certainly trying to stop us though. A blistering 36 degrees hurt more weak fragile English skin, so there was a lot of dipping in and out of museums and malls all day. Morning start at a 3rd different coffee stop, then on to the memorial gardens for a look round the war museum and crypt of Melbourne. Other than nipping into galleries and museums to cool down we didn’t do too much more this day.  Ate a few nachos along the way and was shouted out by the odd crazy homeless guy, but all the norms I expect.  Off we head for our long haul flight. 1 long layover in Kuala lumpa with two 8 hour flights to enjoy each other company. ?

<p>Melbourne was a pretty cool city all in all.  Pretty big and busy to me but plenty of coffee shops to keep us occupied. I’m glad we got time to visit</p>
