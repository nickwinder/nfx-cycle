            <p>This week was the week of hiking and climbing. Hence the title. It was a great introduction to the mountains of the North Island, and really reinforces the reasons why we are here. So this is going to be a quick review of the walks we’ve done.</p>

<p>The first hike was a setup for the bigger hikes, this was a mountain called Pirongia. It was certainly a interesting introduction to NZ hiking tracks. Jumping up and over roots, trees and rocks, then chains to help you climb made it a challenging walk. It was fairly long at 4:30 hours, but the views and the trails were worth it.

An attempted warm shower with our cigarette lighter shower thing ended up with a big bang. Apparently we did something wrong. It doesn’t look like we’ll be using it again.</p>

<p>The next day to relax, we headed out to the hot springs on the beach. A pretty funny experience digging into the sand and creating your own little spa pool. It was pretty beautiful, but then we were invaded by the local school. Frantic kids digging away, throwing sand everywhere. Pretty funny to watch, but not spa like.</p>

<p>We took a weather check to see when we could climb the volcano named Taranaki, down near New Plymouth. It seemed that Wednesday would be one of the only days to climb, so we rushed off for the 3 hour drive down south. On the night we were ready and waiting for the 6am get up, sitting in the rain and keeping our fingers crossed. The mountain is 2518m high, and we were starting at the 900m part. Neither of us had try anything like this before so it would be pretty interesting. 
A cold get up it was, but it was dry, the few clouds that covered the mountain would certainly pass.  The climb consisted of an initial 4x4 track, into stairs, scree then a climb on a lava flow. It was certainly pretty tough, on the scree as it was two steps forward one slip back. The lava flow was pretty challenging also, climbing up through the rocks and gripping on tight in fear of falling. But we made it! 
The way down was tougher on the knees, minds and well, everything. On our bums quite a few times,  it was a great feeling when we finished.

<p>The evening of the climb we started looking at more walks (maybe a bit stupid), and one that had been in our sites was another 3 hours away. The Tongariro Crossing, home to most of the Lord of the Rings filming (Mount Doom), not that I care, as it seems to be touted as the best one day hike in NZ.</p>

<p>Off we drove over a road called The Forgotten Highway. Forgotten it certainly was, in parts it was down to a gravel track which both me and Ashley took a little slide on. Then into the hills there were land slides galore. They seemed to just leave these and stick signs up telling the drivers the road narrows to one lane. All pretty funny.</p>

<p>Another early morning for the hike as it was not a round trip. We had to catch a bus to the start, along with maybe 50 or so other people. We got to the start and there were more people there, who would have known that so many people loved hiking. All through the hike it was far too busy, walking in a precession at some points.  This should not take away from the amazing scenery though, being in and amongst the volcanic region was breath taking. This was a fairly easy 20Km walk for our tired legs, but we still felt it after the week we’ve had. Now it’s time for rest, just in time for the rain.

<p>To end the week, we headed to a local organic farm and walked around with the Maori lady to pick some salad items out. Some of the stuff we’d not heard of, but there was some amazing tasting greens. In the end it was a little bit expensive for our liking, but it tasted great. Nice little treat.

<p>Next week we think we’re going to head down to Wellington to find a bit of work. After all the work on the work on the car (oh I forgot to mention we had a stone hit the windscreen and we had to fill the chip this week), we need to recoup some costs.
