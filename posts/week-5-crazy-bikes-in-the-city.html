            <p>We finished our week in Siem Reap with a little more Wat exploring. Visiting the few that we missed the previous days including the one that was used in the filming of Tomb Raider.</p>

<p>I think we were both ready for a change from the heat and food really. So looking at the temperatures in Hanoi (Vietnam) it was going to be a welcome change. We landed around 10pm and had to go through a pretty complected visa process with Ashley. She had already applied online for the visa, but still needed to get it processed and stamped. A couple of minutes into Vietnam and we’d seen the bribes and corruption already. People were jumping to the front of the queue with cash in the hand and obviously handing it over to the officer to gain priority. There was also men who had prearranged to pick up people from the gate and process multiple passports at a time. I was a lucky one as UK Citizens can get into the country for 15 days for free on a tourist visa. We finally got out at 11pm and jumped in the Taxi the hostel had ordered for us. It was immediately obvious that this place was much different from Cambodia and Thailand. The infrastructure was much more developed which made the drive much more enjoyable. As we got into town we noticed there was still the rubbish on the streets, but the buildings were in good condition and strangely there was still lots of people out on the pavement sitting on kids chairs. We later found out this is the thing to do in Hanoi. That along with the amount of mopeds park on the pavement meant you always had to walk on the road and it was busy. The hostel guys where really nice and welcomed us with drinks and a great intro to Hanoi, all we really needed at this point was a bed.

<p>After a good nights sleep we got out into the city to find food. This was our first experience in the streets during the day and it was crazy. The amount of mopeds is unreal and the road rules are drastically different to what we know. It seems everyone and no one has right of way at any point, crossing roads is mayhem, you just have to walk and hope. We found a nice vegetarian restaurant which was pretty cheap filled ourselves up and headed towards the lake just out side the old town. We guessed this would be less busy. It was alright, they took care of the gardens round the lake and there was plenty of people enjoying the area. Just north of the lake is where all the counterfeit shops started. It seems that North Face has a bit of a problem here. There was so many North Face bags clothes, along with Nike, Adidas and Underamour products. All of them obviously fake, but even if they were they still seemed the same quality as the originals.

<p>Whilst we were staying in Hanoi, Ashley’s friends were flying in to join us from the US. They arrived on our 3rd day, so we had got to know the old town a little better by that point. So we took them round to show them the highlights, but after all that traveling and jet lag they were struggling to stay awake. To top it all off I started to get ill again and by the night time I was sick again. We’re assuming is was something I ate again. I was up most of the night which was a huge shame because it meant I had to miss the trip the next day. The girls still went south to a place called Tam Coc and said it was beautiful. They took a small boat ride down the rivers through the rice paddies with tall cliff edges over hanging either side, the pictures looked spectacular. The sickness passed by the end of the day, but food still wasn’t going down too well. Luckily I was well enough to travel to our next place in Vietnam.

<p>A couple more of Ashley’s friends were flying in and we were all traveling to Cat Ba, near the famous Ha Long Bay.</p>
