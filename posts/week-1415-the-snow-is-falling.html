            <p>The temperatures have finally started to drop and the snow is falling on the mountains. But this doesn’t stop us getting out walking and running. It just makes for better scenery.  Although we have found that the place we are renting is pretty cold. There’s a fine balance between being cold and not spending too much money on heating.  To help with this issue we’ve taken a trip to the charity shop to find some winter woollies.</p>

<p>Again most of this post is going to be pictures of our walks. But I did promise a showcase of my walk to work. So here’s the exciting route. A vast majority of the route passes through the woods between Queenstown and Fernhill.  It’s a great track which weaves in and out of the bike tracks. Oh, how I would love to have a mountain bike here to hit some single track on the way to work! The track traverses across the hill and then drops. It’s pretty steep so quite a climb after work, which doubles as great interval training.

<p>The rest of the way is on road, but still you get a great view across the lake to the mountains around The Remarkables.

So there we have it, a nice 25 minute walk or tough 13 minute run. Depending on which way you’re running</p>

<p>We’ve walked a few places since my last up date. We headed up to the the top of the skyline gondola to get some great views of Queenstown and a beastly mountain named Ben Lomand which we live under.<br />

Other than that we’ve ran some of the trails, some of which are harder than others. Now the temperatures have dropped you have to look out for the ice. It doesn’t help when I can’t even afford to buy new running shoes. Even when I work at a running shop! I’m such a hypocrite when selling these shoes, it’s just lucky they can’t see what I run in.

<p>Not sure what’s in store for the next update. But hopefully I’ll have a snowboard and we’ll both be ready for the winter. We’ve also got tickets to go to the Banff film festival, which is always a good show.</p>
