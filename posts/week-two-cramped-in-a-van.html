            <p>As I finished last week, we were travelling up to my friends. Unbeknownst to us it was not near the centre of Warkworth even though the address says Warkworth. It was in the middle of nowhere. We drove down some of our first windy gravel track roads , which rattled the hell out of our new van.Â</p>

<p>It’s always good to see a friendly face, so we just chilled and chatted for the rest of the night. The next day we got out and did a few things. First breakfast at a garden centre where we noticed there was a valentines performance and pizza night later that day. So we got some tickets and had a double date plus a little baby. Very romantic. But before that we hiked Mt Auckland. Yes it sounds like it’d be a big one seen as its named after the larger city in NZ, but that’s not true. At only 300m we were up it in no time. We had a little run down with a few slips and tree trips and rushed back for our date.Â 
It was a really good night with some great cheesy music. We had a walk around the sculpture garden at the centre, which held some sceptical pieces of art (rubbish).</p>

<p>Up and away again we headed to Waipu (pronounced why poo) which is an old settlement of Scots who came via Nova Scotia. We learnt the story at the great little museum, which held some pictures and memorabilia from Norman and his clan.</p>

<p>The next few days were mostly driving, heading up and down coves every 10 minutes, offering beautiful views and strain on the poor engine. We passed through Russell, which is one of the first capitals on NZ, them jumped on a ferry to a camp spot. This was hard to find. There were a few freedom camping spots along the way, but always slap bang in the middle of a dodgy town. In the end we opted for a cheap campsite with a over enthusiastic woman. $16 for peace and our safety, along with a interesting cowshed come kitchen/toilet.</p>

<p>If anyone been to Vienna you may recognise this architecture.Â</p>

<p>Hundertwasser was his name. If your interested Google him.</p>

<p>We also did a bit of caving. These were completely open and you had to wade your way through for quite a bit of the way. Also, it was important to remember the way back! As we realises half way into the first cave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nfxcycle.com/assets/images/1080.jpg"><img src="http://www.nfxcycle.com/assets/images/1080.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>And then the rain came…… So it’s true. The rain is different here. It went on for two days and was heavey! We had leaks in our van (this was my fault for messing with the sun roof). I only slept 4 hours one night. Let’s hope we don’t get too many days like that.</p>

<p>One of or rainy days was spent at Waitangi treaty grounds. This is the grounds where the basis of the country was born. An agreement between the Maori and the British Empire, which seemed to have come under threat and ignored a lot since 1840 when it was signed by many Maori leaders and British ambassadors.</p>

<p>Back to the sun. Finally we had a run! It may have been only 5km, but it was a great barefoot beach run in two beautiful bays. It is currently where I lay as I’m writing this, sweating already after our first shower in 4 days.</p>

<p>Next week we are heading all the way to the north and then back down to work on a avocado orchard for a few days. We’re going to eat so many.</p>
