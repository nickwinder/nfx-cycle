            <p>For the start of the week we stayed around the sunny Nelson area. We had a trip planned to kayak up the coast of the Abel Tasman and a little bit of sight seeing and walking along the way.</p>

<p>The kayaking was great, I never knew that sea kayaks have rudders on them which are controlled by the feet! It just felt like cheating. It was a double kayak also and you’ll be glad to know me and Ashley had no major fallout’s relating to our kayaking abilities.  It was a great way to see the coast line, as it was mainly dense forest with golden sandy beaches all the way down.  We went to see the famous rock of the area, split apple rock. Yes I know that doesn’t sound exciting, but it’s quite cool. Then we caught a boat further up into the national park and did a little walk.  This place is far busier than any other track we’d been on, which I’m guessing is due to the accessibility, but it was cool walking through what seemed like tropical forest.

<p>After this we rushed down to Christchurch as we’d had a message from a guy who wanted to buy the van. We guessed we should at least attempt to get there and sell the van if possible. So after the 450km road trip, sadly it all fell through. So the van still lives with us.</p>

<p>As we were in the Christchurch area we decided to have a look around, but it’s so unbelievable to see the amount of devastation the earth quake had on the city, even though it was 6 years ago. There still so much waste land in the centre and it almost seems unthinkable that it’s still in this state. The cathedral still stands in ruins as they have not decided what to do with it. Some builds and still waiting to be torn down.  They have tried to make something of the land though, with some interesting art exhibitions and community projects. Along with a shopping area which is entirely housed in shipping containers.

<p>For Christmas we decided to head out to the large peninsular off Christchurch named Akaroa.  The old volcanic region created some spectacular scenery after all the flat lands we’d been seeing. The campsite was amazing with beautiful views and private walks at it’s door step and we had a great time.  Our Christmas dinner consisted of a strange buffet were all the people in the camp ground and hostel brought a dish each. After scoffing as much as possible we went back to the camp ground and had drinks with a dutch couple on there honey moon. It was a nice relaxing Christmas. Oh apart from the 1:30 hour morning run.
