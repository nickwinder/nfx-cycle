            <p>After all the walking that we’d been doing we had to slow down a little and rest our bodies. But this only came after a over night walk to a hut out in the mountains of the west coast. This was the Welcome Flat Hut which is along the Copland Track. This was long used as a link between the valleys dropping into the Mt Cook area across to the West coast.  The walk weaved along the side of the Copland river which was fed from many streams and rivers flowing down from the mountains. This also meant that there was many river crosses with some amazing rope bridges!

The first 100m took us to a river crossing where we had to take our boots off and roll up our shorts to cross. Certainly a exiting way to start. The hut was 18km out, which was ok but made a little harder with the heavy packs and climbing over the active slip areas. It took us 6 hours to get to the hut and the landscape was spectacular all the way. With the hut only being $15 it was fairly cheap for huts in NZ and it had a great communal with dorm style sleeping upstairs. But the highlight of the hut was the geothermal pools located just metres away from the door. These were super hot, with great views but the only thing that let it down was the sand flies constantly nipping at your shoulders. It just wasn’t possible to stay in there too long because of this. All in all, it was a great over night walk and lucky timing for us also. Just 2 days later the track closed with flash river flooding. A common occurrence in the mountains here.

<p>Other than the picturesque drive along the west coast, the other attractions in this area was the two large glaciers that once swept all their way into the ocean. We went to see both, but again it was a rather sorry sight for glaciers, hugely receded perched up in the clouds. Leaving huge amounts of glacial debris over the past few years.

<p>After this we decided to slow down and take a break from walking and running to let our bodies rest. We headed all the way up the West coast pretty much as far as possible and found a really nice campsite to stay for a few days. We sorted all our flights for the next few months and planned where we would be going. Also working out if our budget would allow for it. Hopefully it will!

<p>Lastly we headed off to Nelson for some warmer weather and to see what the great walk Abel Tasman has to offer. So next week we’ll be heading out for that somehow and back south towards Christchurch.</p>
