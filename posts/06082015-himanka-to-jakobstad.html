            <p>Another rest day yesterday and it was quite a interesting one. The ride today was not quite as interesting and wet again….. Oooo dear. Let’s hope I don’t have too much of that.</p>

<p>For the rest day I was still with the WS host. His wife cooked up some porridge with some local fresh blueberries. Super nice and it beats my camp stove version.</p>

<p>For today he decided to take me on his little boat out to sea and around the islands. It was a super great experience and I got to drive for a bit. Basically watch out for rocks. We went out to two little wooden cottages, which are maintained by the forestry agency. They are unbelievably good, they have a little wood burning stove , 2 bunk beds and all the wood you could ever need. You can see people use them and keep them in very good condition. I really wish I had time to stay a night, as the view out to sea would be great at sun set.</p>

<p>When we got home I could smell the aromas of lasagne. Home cooked with no mushrooms, yet again luxury. I’ve really been spoilt. I had 2nd and 3rd helpings, just to try and get as much inside me as possible. Lots of conversation, vodka, beer and sauna was had. It was all great.</p>

<p>I set off today at around 10, straight away I could tell the rest helped so much. I felt…. kinda fresh. Even though the rain was coming down, it didn’t matter, I just kept on ploughing on.</p>

<p>The most successful thing today was purchasing dinner. I jumped into a little cafeteria next to the petrol station and start to copy the person in front of me. Bit of salad, cottage cheese, pastry things and egg. Grabbed a coffee cup and head to the till. It came up as â‚¬4, and I was like ‘ha what about the rest’ , but no all I had to pay for was the pastry and coffee. I couldn’t believe my luck and ran away quickly. I really need to find one of these places again and work out what I can get away with.</p>

<p>I’ve just arrived in Jakobstad at another WS hosts. Yeah its a little cheeky to do 2 in a row but there is none until Turku now, so I’ll take them where I can. All seems nice, just gotta dodge the cats every now and then.
