            <p>Starting on a new journey, but this time it’s in one of our home countries. It’s going to be pretty exciting for me as I’ve not explored much of the US and especially not many of the national parks. The other reason for this trip is to find an area we’d like to live. We’ve got a few places in mind, but it’s certainly time to check out those and a few more.</p>

<p>Our journey started from Austin Texas. We’d been staying with friends and family for a few weeks, mainly in Houston but Austin was not a place to be missed. As most of Texas is pretty boring we’d decided to undertake a long 10 hour drive to get out the state and into some better scenery. It actually ended up taking around 12 hours to get to our first rest place in New Mexico near Santa Fe. Safe to say, Texas can be really boring, I just can’t imagine living in the flat dusty lands heading out towards New Mexico. It’s also amazing to think that we drove for half the day, in the UK traffic you’d be tearing your hair out, but around here there was minimal traffic, so we kept our selves occupied with podcasts and music.

<p>The next day, we headed into the town of Santa Fe to grab some coffee and see the old style architecture of the area. These buildings were called Adobe’s (home in Spanish) and we squared off clay structures with super think walls. One of the oldest buildings was the Spanish church mission from the 1600’s (although we believe it was heavily repaired) which held the name of a famous saint from Assisi, Italy. A place we’d visited last year so that was a interesting link to find. After eating some Mexican, we set off to Colorado. A scenic 4 hour drive which seem to become greener and greener as we got over the boarder. It was still hot mind you, it’d always been pushing 100 Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) for a good few days now. This is when we found out that we were in the middle of a heat wave. A great prospect when thinking about traveling through some of the hottest deserts of the US. We got into Durango a little late, only to find that there’d been some event on during the day and a scheduled rodeo the day after. It was a vibrant town with some beautiful surroundings, after getting some last minute tips from the tourist information office, we drove to the campsite just outside of the town only to find that it was full. Ashley persuaded me to put on my best English accent and see if there was anywhere we could fit in. It worked! The camp host let us stay on a spot which was far to large for us, but at the normal price. We’d now learnt our lesson about busy camp grounds, either play the English card or book ahead.

<p>Armed with our suggestions for running trails we headed out north towards Silverton and into the mountains. The event from the previous day seemed to run into today as we were passing masses of cyclist filling the road and slowing everyone down. But for a Tuesday this was amazing! I’ve no idea how all these people were off work. We found the trail head and walked down a long descent into the creek to start our run. Only after 3Km of running we passed some local walkers warning us of snakes ahead. This spooked me a lot, we’d left the safe heaven of NZ with no predators to harm you and swapped it for this, snakes, bears, mountain lions! I soon made the decision to turn back, you know you can’t push it far, especially in this elevation :) . And I decided to give it a go and run up the hill. It’s amazing how the altitude hits you, at around 2000m up the lack of oxygen makes you feel like it’s your first ever run, but I was determined and after around a 20 minute slog I only had to walk a couple of times. We drove back to Durango to have a stroll round the town and shake off our heavy legs. This time the town was a little quieter and it was nice walking down the main street and seeing the 3 brewery options in a small town (no we didn’t go and try, it was a little early) and then seeing the old steam trains that still make the journey up to Silverton. Our camping spot was around 30 minutes outside of Durango near Mancos. This time it was no where near as busy as the previous night.

<p>The next day was an early get up. We were going to our first national park and wanted to beat the crowds, book some tours and dodge the heat. Mesa Verde is an old Native American settlement that was abandoned in the 1300’s. It’s very unusual to find such historic structures in America as it seems most people of the land were fairly nomadic. But this exception gave way to buildings built into the side of cliffs, much like you’d expect in Petra. Some of the structures dated all the way back to the 800’s, the tribes occupied this area for a long time, but in the 1300’s that all changed. Everything was left and we are still unsure of the real reason for this. Some say it is spiritual, and some say it was due to drought, but it’s hard to see why they would leave these amazing dwellings behind.
We had a few tours around the different cliff houses which it meant we were a little late setting off for our campsite stop. We’d already booked this in Page, Arizona which was around 5 hours away. This sadly meant we had to miss monument valley, but still the vast canyons and cliffs impressed all the same.

<p>We had a tour booked in the morning at 7:30am, this is why we had to rush over from Mesa Verde the previous night. The views from this campsite which over looked Lake Powell into Utah where just amazing. It’s a shame we could make better use of it, but we had to be up and off. As we were heading to our tour we quickly realised that we were 1 hour to early. As we were so close to the boarder of Utah, the clocks on our phones had changed. Strangely Arizona is a state that does not observe day light saving. So we had an extra hour to kill at 6:30am and what do you do in that situation? Go to Walmart of course, because they are always open. We had our gourmet artisanal aeropress coffee in a Walmart car park. Classy. Anyway, Antalope canyon. This was a really expensive tour as it was on Native American lands, but it was not one to miss. Flash floods in the area create some amazing formations in a once small crack of the canyon. Up until the 90’s no one really knew about it until National Geographic featured it in their magazine and now they are having to put limits on the amount of people coming every year. But it was a great idea to go so early as we were one of the first groups through, which allowed us to get some great pictures. As we returned back through canyon we were inundated with tours, it just got so busy. Next we drove out through the dry deserts out to the Grand Canyon where we’d be staying for the next few nights.

<p>Looking out the Grand Canyon is deceiving, on the Rim you are around 2500 metres high but down at the bottom it drops to around 700 metres. It’s just so hard to get the scale of the place, but the figures show that it’s just like the mountain ranges in NZ, but inverted. We took a run around the rim to get different view, again it was really hard at this altitude and I was still struggling with the heat. We also drove round to another point which gave a better view down the canyon and to overlook the Colorado River. It would be great to do the North to South rim crossing, but 2-3 days in the reported 120F heat is not something I’m up for right now. The North rim is a really nice place to camp and I assume a great alternative to be away from the busy tours of the South Rim.

<p>After leaving the Grand Canyon, not much was on the agenda apart from heading up to Bryce Canyon or Zion in Utah, again two amazing national parks with completely unique landscapes. This place may be hot, but it produces some amazing scenery. More of this in the weeks to come I’m sure.</p>
