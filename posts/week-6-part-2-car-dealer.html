            <p>The main focus of the next few weeks is really to sell the van and live as cheaply as possible. The main reason for this is because the promise of jobs never came through. Apparently the guy who had the contacts died, which is a strange situation if it is true as we meet him a few days previously.</p>

<p>Now with no jobs and van on our hands to sell, we found a free campsite outside of Christchurch and tried to work out what to do. Luckily I’d had an offer to do a bit of programming work. I’m glad to say this one came through and I’m can get back to some comfortable work, that’s keeping me busy. Ashley meanwhile is brushing up on her art skills and transferring some of it on to the computer, using graphical tools to make art. Hopefully we can see some soon!</p>

<p>We also went to a kiwi house party with a older couple that Ashley met in Queenstown. They were kind enough to invite us along to their friends BBQ, which was slightly awkward at first, but soon most of them warmed up to us and we had a good night.</p>

<p>We rang in the new year in style! Setting the alarm for 11:59pm, saying happy new year and falling back asleep. This was probably due to the bottle wine we treated ourselves to in the afternoon though.</p>

<p>Other than that we have been fairy quiet, exploring Christchurch a little. Found one great coffee place.
