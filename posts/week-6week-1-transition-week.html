            <p>It’s country transition week for us! We are swapping the cooler islands of Japan to the blazing hot area of South East Asia. Thailand is our first stop on this trip, this was an attempt to ease us into the hectic way of life.</p>

<p>First we had a few more days in Tokyo. We explored the areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku which we missed on out last visit and also the last couching surfing experience we were expecting for a while.
From the plane we had a long 3 hour journey across the whole of Tokyo to get to the Shinjuku area.  The hosts were in a great area for exploring the city, being walking distance from many of the attractions.  When we got there we were greeted by one of the hosts and he took us through the do’s and don’ts of the house.  We actually didn’t realise that it was shared house focused on introducing the Japanese culture to foreigner visitors.  There were currently 4 permanent residence and a couple of airbnb guests coming and going.  Yet again a completely different experience with couch surfing.  If I was ever advising anyone on couch surfing I would always say, anticipate nothing, things will always be different to what you are thinking.</p>

<p>On our first night back in Tokyo, we went to meet one of Ashley’s friends from Manchester.  He took us to a traditional after work shindig, which consisted of drinking as much as possible in a specific time limit. We were cheap and went for 90 minutes, it was all you can drink from a pretty decent list of cocktails, beers and spirits.  You only really understand this way of drinking when you hear the amount of hours that the Japanese work.  They do not have much time to themselves therefore the drinking has to happen fast.  90 minutes was enough for us, we were done for the night.</p>

<p>The next day we went in search of sights in Shibuya, this is one of the more famous areas of Tokyo and holds probably one of the most photographed pedestrian crossings in the world. We saw the crazy 6 way crossing the night before and it was packed with people going in all directions. It’s amazing people find their way through the crowds. But other than that, there is more shopping and again, big lights. We walked all the way through to Meiji park, which is remarkably quiet considering it’s proximity to the hustle and bustle that we’d just come from.  Of course there was a temple in the middle of the park and we got to see part of a traditional wedding, the bride was shuffling along on her small shoes, which I’m sure were impossible to walk on.

We headed back to the house for a catch up and a meal with the host we met on the first night.  We cooked a little chilli and he cooked Okinimiyaki, and this time he showed us how to make it also.  So expect us to try and make this next time we stay with you!  After this 2 random guys came round to the house and we were all chatting together.  We only found out late in the conversation that they were looking to move into the place.</p>

<p>On the last full day of Tokyo I had to do a bit of work, so Ashley headed off to the Edo museum, which I’m assured was pretty interesting.  Instead I got to try and ignore all the kids shouting about in Mcdonalds.  If anyone ever goes to Japan, if you need Wifi and a coffee, McDonalds has both, even if the coffee’s are poo but it’s only 100 yen.
This time we cooked our own food back at the house, but hung out with pretty much all the flat mates.  One of the guys works at a Sake shop, so he let us taste lots of different Shochu (strong distilled liquor) and plenty of different sakes, which are so much nicer.  It was a pretty good last night for our Japan trip.

<p>The next day and a half were filled with travelling, so there’s not too much to talk about here. But we were finally on our next leg of the trip.</p>

<p>We arrived into Chaing Mai a little tied and overdressed.  It was blazing hot outside.  So we took taxi straight to our Hostel for the next few days and got changed.  The next port of call was insect replant, as we were not really wanting to pick up any diseases from the mosquito’s here.  Luckily this is easy to find here as they have Boots.  It’s pretty funny to see these English brands here, there’s also Tesco.  Our first meal was at a small family run place, we both had a small main and rice along with a large Chang beer each, and it came to 250 Baht, which is just under 6 pounds.  This is when we knew we’d be eating out for every meal during our stay.  After a small trundle round the night bazaar we called it a night.</p>

<p>After a good nights rest we went in the direction Chiang Mai old town.  We headed over the moat and through the old city walls in search of the historic Wat’s (temples).  Right in the centre of the walls was a famous Wat which had been patched up after an earthquake 1545. Around this were extravagant temples in perfect condition with lots of paintings and artwork.  One of which Ashley could not enter as it would be humiliating to the Buddhists, I just found this pretty funny as I left her at the steps.

Later that night we headed to a Muay Thai fight.  Apparently that’s the thing to do when you are here.  But it was pretty weird to watch the first few fights as kids of around 12 years old stepped into the ring. After that there were a few other fights, but it all seemed a little half hearted and showmanship like.

<p>This next week we’re staying around Northern Thailand, where we are heading up to the small mountain town of Pai.</p>
