            <p>We’re on the move again and this time it’s to another country. We flew into Phnom Penh (we now know you say it Pnom Pen), the capital of Cambodia.  We’ve heard it is a little further behind in terms of poverty and living conditions, so it was interesting to see what we would experience and how we would feel about this.  When we first got into the airport we had to get our visa, we handed our passports over and we could only hope they would give them back and allow us in. $30 dollars each and 20 mins later we could head through customs and find a taxi.  We jumped in a taxi and gave the directions for our hotel, but we were just in time for rush our.  The traffic was crazy, and I don’t just mean busy, I mean bikes and tuk-tuks everywhere and hurtling in ever direction. I just do not understand how a road system can work like this.  But if you look at the road traffic accident stats you start to understand.  After 50 minutes, 20 of which were at a stand still, we got to our hotel. The sun had already gone down so we couldn’t see too much of the streets, but the first thing that stood our was the rubbish. Piles on open rubbish from food waste to plastics just left in piles on the pavement. This is just something we had to get used to here.  Our hotel was ok, but you do not get as much for your money as you do in Thailand.  Our room had no window, pretty basic but we didn’t need much more.  We had enough to time to go for a bite to eat, which was a bit different but still pretty good and then it was bed time.</p>

<p>We left our first full day open to walk around and try and get used the the place. We walked over to the old market for a look round and to the large central Wat.  The general feeling I get of the place is a tale of two sides.  There are a few massive high rise builds and also some grand government buildings, but on the other side of the scale we saw a child on the street have to go to toilet in a bag.  It just doesn’t make sense, I assume the flashy looking buildings apparently mostly built by Chinese companies are bringing jobs and we assume money into the city. You can only hope the rest of the city can catch up and benefit from this.  Another place to see in the city was the Imperial Palace.  This was a another place with a lot of money thrown.  As soon as we got into this area you could tell you’d hit the tourist area as the Tuk-Tuk drivers were there trying to drum up some business. But we’d had enough of the heat and had to head back indoors.  Other main place to visit in Phnom Penh is the Killing Fields and S21 prison.  We booked a Tuk-Tuk through our hotel to go and see these two sad places the next day.

<p>So today was always going to be a sad day. Cambodia has had a troubled recent past, which I can certainly say I knew nothing about.  We would be learning about this much of the day.  The first stop was outside of the city named The Killing Fields in English, but Choeung Ek in Khmer (Cambodian). Cambodia went through a tough communist regime from 1975 until 1979 were it is estimated that 1.2 - 2.8 million people died due to disease, starvation and execution.  The number varies so drastically as the country was completely cut off throughout these years, the regime believed that outside forces were destructive to the country and people were force to go into jobs to help sustain the country through self sufficiency.  Cities were emptied of people and all were moved back to farms, although most did not have the skills to farm, and areas where people were expected to farm were doomed from the start. Along with this redistribution of the people,  came brutal executions of any educated people and even people who wore glasses, as this was seen as a sign of the educated. This brings us to the Killing Fields, we took a short walk round this area with mass graves and listened to the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. Many people were killed at this spot and remains still surfaced every year as the rain washes away the mud.
The next place we visited was a old school building which the Khmer Rouge took over and was later named S21.  It was a torture and prison system run by the communist in order to get confessions from individuals they believed had wronged the regime.  The buildings where open to be explored as a museum now in a hope it would educate locals and tourists about the times under the Khmer Rouge.  The re-purposed class rooms where divided up into prison cells which were pretty small, but it was the stories of torture and conditions which were really hard hitting. I feel we’re both very grateful that these places are opened up and we can learn about this time as it seems they are not represented in the west very often. I purposely did not take many pictures of these places as it’s not really what it’s about. The picture I do have is from the memorial from the Killing Fields which holds many of the skulls which have surfaced from the mass graves.

<p>The next stop in Cambodia is Siem Reap, which is probably where most people go in Cambodia.  This is because it’s the home to the famous Angkor Wat.  This is a 12th century temple built by the Khmer Kingdom of the time.  It is famed for being one of the best and most beautiful temples of its time and it’s just pretty amazing that it’s still there.  Around this is area is a lot of other temples all built at different times, some dating back to 900AD and all in varying conditions. One day we caught a Tuk-Tuk at 5am to go and watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat.  This is a really popular thing to do here and we joined the masses to do the same. Sadly there were a few clouds, but it did mean that we could look round the temples whilst it was still cooler. I’m just going to leave the rest of this to the pictures.

<p>Other than the Wats in this area we can see a drastic change in the country here.  The obvious tourist investment has made a big difference here.  There is still the Cambodian rubbish hanging around, but there’s thriving local restaurants and markets, although the western brands are trying to budge there way in with Hard Rock Cafe and Costa on one side of the river. But the prices they attempt to charge is just laughable in this area so they are mostly empty.  We’ve had some pretty average food, but we have to say our stomachs have not agreed, we’ve both struggled pretty bad and Ashley certainly had food poisoning one day (ironically from one of the more western cafes).  So if you ever visit the area, just be prepared. Also, it is so hot. The temperatures have been topping 41 Celsius here. From the early morning it just becomes unbearable until around 6pm at night, we have really tried to stay out and make the most of our time, but it just becomes impossible and you have to jump into somewhere cool for a good majority of the day. This is why I believe it takes so long to see the area, we can’t do our normal thing of taking a long day to see everything as you would just die from heat exhaustion.</p>

<p>A few more days left in Siem Reap and then we’re heading to Vietnam to attempt a new language.</p>
