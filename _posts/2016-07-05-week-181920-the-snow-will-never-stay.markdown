It seems as if the snow will never stay. The ski fields are in a bit of a dire state, with only one of them remaining open. This means that it is packed, therefore I've decided to veto snowboarding until the weather picks up. 

This does mean it's given us more time to find the trails and tracks when we've had time off and when my feet have permitted. We started along a trail which leads to a old mining town in the middle of nowhere. It's one link I'd like to make when the summer comes around again.

Other than that, we've been having fun testing the local pubs and even contended in the vertical beer mile! This is where you have to drink a beer then run 400m up and downhill 4 times. Surprisingly me and Ashley weren't too good at this and we dropped out 1 or 2 beers in! We're hoping to improve that at the next meet.
