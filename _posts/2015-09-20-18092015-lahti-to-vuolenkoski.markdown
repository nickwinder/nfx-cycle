I was pretty lost today, I just couldn't decide what I wanted to do. Head off and get to the Russian boarder. Do a little less and go and see a UNESCO site. Stay in Lahti somehow. 

So I ended up wondering the streets looking around and procrastinating in general. Looking around Lahti there seemed to be so much going on. Millions of campervans, I later found out it was a campervan event. An annual fish festival. A huge conference going on at one of the major halls. It was all pretty interesting. To add to that, I found out most of Finland is on strike today. Police, healthcare, public transport, food services and more. Something to do with Sunday pay. I didn't really get it,Ã‚  but it did mean things seemed a bit strange. Not seeing any buses on the road and not a huge amount of people in the centre.

So I headed up to the fish market area to see what was going on. During this time a huge thunderstorm hit. Everyone was dashing for cover and I ended up outside a restaurant with a few other people. After waiting for 20mins for it to pass, we decided that it was here to stay. I poked my head in the door of the restaurant to see what was going on (I later found out this was one of the posh restaurants in town). There was no one there apart from the waitress. This is when I found out about the strikes, and she was saying this was the reason why they were not busy. She made me a coffee and gave me the WiFi password, so I was set. I stuck in there for about an hour, catching up with Ashley and trying get this blog up to date. 
I went to pay and then started chatting with the waitress, trying to get some tips on what to do, where to go etc. Etc. We had a good chat and she gave me the coffee for free in the end. Which was great! You just need to chat to people and they help. 

I took that mantra and went to talk to the campervan organisers, to see if they'd let me pitch a tent next to the event. That didn't go to well. No one spoke English, and then I found the main hub and it was a straight up no. Bad luck, it meant I was leaving Lahti.

Riding out I was racing the weather slightly. It looked threatening all the time, although the wind was going my way this time. This made it nice and easy. I got to one laavu about 20km out, I cooked some food up but decided that there were far too many people hanging around to stay over night. I like the quiet places. Also as the wind was pushing me along, which made 20km feel like 5km. So I headed for another laavu which I saw on the map. What a mistake that was, this one looked out onto the football field. I'd look like a homeless person if I slept there. Which I suppose technically I am, but thats not the point. So with this decision of leaving a nice laavu behind looming over my head, I had to start looking for camp spots. 

Barely out the village I saw a little run off up a hill. I went for it, and it turned out to be a little sheltered wooded area. It should be good enough as long as there's no dog walkers around and the trees don't fall down. It's pretty windy at the moment and also dark already and its only 8pm, just something I need to get used to for the times ahead.
