Japan is finally here for us. It's been a long time waiting but we are finally in Japan. Ready for whatever culture shock it'd like to throw at us. But first impressions are really great and friendly, with the odd comical moment for a mere westerners like us. We arrived into Tokyo and the airbnb host had offered to pick us up at 10:30pm which was really nice of him.  The first airbnb we were staying at was a room above a bar. We really splashed out on this one at $15 a night ? , I'm sure that's the cheapest you'll find in Tokyo.  The room was pretty good, and it threw us in right at the deep end. Sleeping on the tamami floors with thin futons, it doesn't get more Japanese. One rather weird part to the place was the toilet situation, or lack of it. We had to go down to the bar for the toilet, which strangely opening 8pm - 8am.  This did mean the late night wee now got a bit more interesting. But again I refer back to the price. You cannot beat it.

For our first day in Tokyo we planned to head to the Imperial palace, a couple of temples and shrines and generally expect the craziness.  All the public transport and crowds were not quite as bad as we were expecting, and the promptness of the public transport is all true, it's great. I don't think we waited for anything all day. Sadly we couldn't get into the Imperial Palace, apparently only special tours and invited guest can enter. I don't see why they had a problem with me. So instead we headed to the fish markets for some food, it all looked pretty good but we could quite afford the prices there. So we got some dodgy corner shop meals. Not the nicest but they would do. Then we headed out to the famous Ueno area, which had some cute, busy market streets, which sprawled for miles. We bustled our way through there to hit the gardens and a couple of temples. These were the first we were seeing in the country so it was pretty special. We hadn't really seen much like these before and the architecture smooth and well, oriental. We had one more temple for the day and we were done for the day. This was the one of the most famous in Tokyo, probably due to it's size and prominent stature, it's actually a fairly recent build due to the bombings in the war, but there's been a temple on this site since 645.

From now on all didn't go to plan. I started feeling pretty sick in the morning and didn't stop throwing up all day. All I could do was lay on the super hard futon and aim my sick in the small bin which I had to rinse out in the bar toilet every time. Not an ideal place to be sick either. Ashley headed out to the Tokyo National Museum as I was not much fun to be with. I was a pretty sorry start to out Japan tour. The sickness lasted into the next day, but luckily I was well enough get to the bus station to catch our connection to Matsumoto.  The bus journey gave us fantastic views of Mt. Fuji and I can only wish we were going closer. The snow capped peak was huge and dominated the landscape.

Still onto Matsumoto. Our main reason for visiting this area was to see Matsumoto castle which had been there for 500 years. We had 2 nights there, but it wasn't a big place to get around so we enjoyed a lazy afternoon and a curry from possibly the only Indian we were going to meet in Matsumoto. He turned out to be a super nice guy and gave us some great grub and nice freebies to go away with.

Day number 2 in Matsumoto consisted of a visit of the castle grounds and building.  One visit we nearly walked away from because the price, but it is lucky we didn't in the end.  We tagged along with a free tour and manage to eventually get the guide to ourselves for most of the tour. Masashi had pretty good English and as always the Japanese hospitality.  The castle and it's history was pretty interesting, even though it stood in this place since 1579 it had never seen any fighting, hence the reason why it was still in good condition.  They had done some major structural work as it was pretty much as bad as the learning tower of pisa at one point, but most of the shell was perfect. Back to the Indian again of course, for more delicious grub, this time with free vegan chai and other than that we were pretty much just wondering round. Also by now we are well into winter. It's in the minus figures and snow's falling most days. It's amazing!

Next stop was Takayama and this meant we had to take the bus over the Japanese Alps. I was really excited to go through the mountains, especially as the snow had been falling. I can certainly say it did not disappoint. The bus winded through some snowy hill passes and narrow tunnels to bring us out at some spectacular valleys with skiing and onsens.

Takayama is a relatively small town with part of it's old town still intact, the abundance of snow only made the small street better. At this place we checked into our first hostel. It's got to be one of the best hostels we've ever been to. It's built in a old Japanese home and everything is spic and spam. The bunks have electric blankets curtains round every bunk. The bunks are even separated by false walls, which almost makes it feel like your own room. On the face of it, it was a bit expensive for us, but it's well worth the money.

We've done plenty of exploring around the old town and also up into the bear infested park of the castle ruins. Quite funny really, as we traipsed through the snow only to work out all the ruins are covered in snow, obviously.  Still it was fun to play in the snow. We've been on a quick Sake tour to find out how they make there local liquor and tasted 13 different varieties.  None of which are too our tastes really. We have also looked round one of the open air museums here, which have lots of the old houses of the region relocated into one place. All these building are wooden, some with thatched roofs and some with wooden roofs, but one amazing thing is the size of them . It seems the always ensured they had enough inside space. And always the fire was in the middle of the rooms. I can imagine a lot of these house burnt down by accident.

Next week we are heading a little further west into the Nagoya and Nara. One of the old capitals of Japan.
