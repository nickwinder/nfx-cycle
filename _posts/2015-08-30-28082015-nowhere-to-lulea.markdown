So we knew that the sun had to end at some point. And today was that day. I found out that when it rains, it rains...... I've seen better weather in the lake district.

I had to get to LuleÃ¥ today, because I had told the warm showers guy that I was gonna be there. If that wasn't the case I would have stop much earlier to find shelter. I did have one stop at a kaffe and figa shop, my first! Basically its a cake and coffee shop, the coffee wasn't the best, but anything warm at that point was great. 

I ploughed on and finally I got to LuleÃ¥ and the rain was finally stopping. It seems like a really nice little city. A buzzing town centre which wasn't too large. Green areas to keep the balance, and right on the river. 

I had to wait around a little for the warm showers guy cause he was still working. When he turned up he seemed like a nice happy chappy, he'd already been super generous letting me stay and I've got to say it was a good first experience of warm showers. We went for a few drinks in the evening and I was well and truly knackered. It was great to sleep in a bed again.
