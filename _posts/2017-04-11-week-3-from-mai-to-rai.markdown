There was a few things we missed in Chiang Mai the first time round, so we made sure that we got to all the attractions before we left. One of these was the Wat perched up on top of the hill over looking Chiang Mai.  The only way to get up this big hill was to jump in the back of Chaing Mai's famous red trucks. Essentially a black cab of Chaing Mai, but it's a pick-up truck with a cover over the top. When we got to the pickup point we had to wait around until there was 10 people to fill the truck, which only meant around a 20 minute wait. Luckily we didn't fly out the back of the truck and get sick on the way up the hill so we were primed to see this great Wat. It was pretty busy as you'd expect with markets down at the bottom of 100 or so stairs. Climbing to the top there was a sign directing tourist to the ticket area, right next to the toilets for Men, Women and Monks. I was so tempted to jump into the Monks toilets just to see what was different.  The temple was pretty gold, and very extravagant, but a little smaller than we expected it to be.  The views were pretty good to see a good overview of the city, but still a little hazy to really get a good picture. We hung around for a bit and headed back down to the market to have a few snacks and a coffee before we left.  I can see why people are told to go up there but I still believe the better Wats are in town.

That was pretty much it for us in Chiang Mai, we'd seen what we wanted to see and we ended up just exploring places which felt pretty familiar by now.  Just in time for a change.

We hopped on the bus to go to Chiang Rai, the name of the city and the province which boarders Laos and Myanmar.  The bus ride was much more enjoyable this time and we felt the scenery was becoming much more interesting. Chiang Rai laid mainly on a plain surrounded by the mountains leading into Myanmar.  When we got to the city it still had the hustle and bustle, but was just a little more manageable.  Most of the centre was walkable, and the traffic was a little less chaotic.  There were a couple things we wanted to see in this area, but we were mostly open to ideas. We passed by a few tourist shops and eventually got ushered into one. The guy was very thorough with his break down of the tour itinerary and also very informative about the region.  This came as a bit of a surprise for us when comparing him to the rest of the tourist touts, normally they just shout prices at you. So we decided to trust him and took him up on the offer of 1000 baht.

We were picked up in the morning by a guide in a truck with only one other person on the tour, which could be seen as a good or bad thing. Only time would tell. Though this did give us the flexibility and deciding what we wanted to do.  One of the stops was supposed to be a visit to the local village tribes, but 300 baht per person just to enter the area seemed a little strange and talking with the other women with us we decided it sound more like a human zoo than a cultural experience so we vetoed that one. But because we had a little more time, a trip into Myanmar was put on to the table as the other woman had to jump over the boarder to renew her visa anyway.  Still our first stop was at Chiang Rai's famous white temple.  It certainly stood out, but all hopes of a historic reason for the white temple were dashed when we were told it was only built 20 years ago by a local artist.  This started to make much more sense when looking round around the grounds and inside the temple.  Paintings inside even showed money, guns and even a representation of the twin towers being hit.  Not what I would expect from a Buddhist temple, but still very spectacular.

Our next stop was the Monkey Caves. None of us really knew what this was going to be but obviously we expected monkeys.   When we arrived it resembled a slightly run down amusement park with lots of monkeys hanging around.  A fair few people were carrying sticks around, which we only found out later was to hit the monkeys away if they became a little to aggressive. Great. The guide lead us through to a huge set of steps which vanished into the cliff front and told us we can go up and see the caves although he would be staying at the bottom. Again, just another reason to have full confidence in this place. But we were here, we had to go and have a look what this thing was.  When we reached the top, a tall slit in the cliff face stood in front of us with a small opening, we headed over were two men said hello and invited us in.  Inside was a fairly large place with a shrine towards the back of the caves, it was really cool and relaxing space, and completely worth all the weirdness that proceeded it.

Off to Myanmar we go! Although there was a bit of visa confusion, which we did not really want to risk. We were told that it was $10 each to get a quick visit visa (We weren't actually carrying enough money), but we were a little sceptical on the simplicity and the general visit visa tour guide was explaining, especially as we were from different countries.  We opted out and let the other woman do her visa run and stayed on the Thai side.  We looked this up later and it seems it would have been possible, but the possibility of getting stuck in a country with no money was not a risk worth taking.
Another boarder hope was on the cards, but this was one agreed up front and one that was a popular route with tourist so we decided this was all good. We headed for the golden triangle, the point in which Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet along the Mekong river. We took tiny speed boat over to the other side of the river to get into Laos were we paid 30 baht or so to get a little paper pass essentially saying "Welcome to Laos".  Even though this was on Loas' land, again it was just a big scam to me.  We were told we would be visiting a village only to find a market with pushy sellers. I'm pretty sure Thailand and Laos have something set up here just to extort money out of tourist. I later looked up the land round that area and it looks as it's pretty much a little island within the river with one small road leading onto the Laos main land. So ok, it is technically Laos, but there was no way I was getting anywhere near the real country.

After these slight disappointments, we headed to another Thai boarder town where we stopped at an old brick Wat.  Again it was really peaceful here and the brick gave the Wat and Pagodas a really different feel. It was a nice relaxing way to finish the tour and it makes you appreciate what Thailand can really offer.

The next few days of Chiang Rai were much less eventful. I had a lot of work to get done, so it mainly consisted of hanging out at the hotel and a couple of coffee stops. The hotel was one of the best we'd stayed at for a while and the guy running it used to live in the UK so we had a good connection there. We checked out the night markets, which had some great cheap Pad Thai and dancers on stage (we later found out they were lady boys, no i didn't know). Their own Saturday walking market was also really big with huge loud performances going on in the square. You could buy all type of food and clothes. Anything you could think of.

On the Sunday we headed back to Chiang Mai for our early flight to Cambodia on the Monday. We visited one last Wat outside the city walls, and there we found the monks were all praying and chanting. There was maybe about 50 all in a room next to her temple, it was a surreal experience.

Next stop and next country. Cambodia.
