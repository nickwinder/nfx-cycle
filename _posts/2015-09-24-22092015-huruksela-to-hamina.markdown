I woke up and did a little reading as I've done most days. I started to get my self sorted and changed just before 8am I heard a guys voice. "Morning!" (In Finnish). Wooo, I thought this was going to be a quiet spot. Lucky I'd just got my shorts on. The guy had come to start a fire, because 15 of his mates were coming down for breakfast. He didn't speak much English, but I got that much. I didn't stick around long to find out what he actually said.

With a fairly boring ride, I found my way to Hamina. It seems like a military town for the Finnish, which did mean there wasn't much there to see apart from men running around and drunk people on the streets. But one thing that has stuck me though. Things are in Russian! It's strange to see.

I thought about staying at the campsite, but I decided I'd rather save the money. So I camped in the woods opposite where I had hide from the occasional dog walker and berry picker.
