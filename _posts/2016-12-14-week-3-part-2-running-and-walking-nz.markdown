After a long while living near one of the great walks of New Zealand we finally got the opportunity to do it. The Routeburn is a 31km track running from the Fjordland area all the way over to area surrounding Queenstown. As it's a one way track we had to drop off our car at one end and get a lift round to the start. After the 3.5 hour drive to the divide (start) we were ready to get underway. Sadly it just started raining, but we still had high hopes. It started with a gentle incline which was easily runnable and not too technical. But still the clouds would not lift, this didn't matter too much as we were mainly in the trees.  We passed some fancy looking huts along the way, but we were doing this in one day, so straight passed them we went climbing all the way to the highest point on the track. Only after this point we started getting some views, the valley down towards the shelter at the end was amazing. Tall peaks towered up separated by tarns and rivers. It was a tough run down from here, with plenty of large lose rock turning your ankles on every step. We headed into our last 5km and both of our knees just died. They were so bad we had to walk the rest, even though the track was the easiest part of the whole day. In the end we got through in just under 7 hours. Maybe it wasn't the fastest time but we sure enjoyed it. And we'd love to do it again.

After this we headed over to Mt Cook. The largest mountain in NZ. This time hoping to catch a glimpse as it is often in the clouds. When we headed into the village most of the mountains were in the clouds, not allowing us to see Mt Cook, so we headed on some of the walks to the glaciers instead. It was good seeing these although it is unreal the amount they have receded in recent years and it certainly won't be long before the walks will have to be extended to see them.  As the evening went on the clouds started to part, and we were lucky to be staying in Mt Cook village overnight. We got some great view of Mt Sefton, which has some unreal ice and rock formations, but still Mt Cook was in the clouds. After hours of waiting we went to bed. We woke in the morning to low cloud again! This time I was convinced we could get above the clouds on a track with 2200 steps. At 8am we set off to gain some altitude. About half was up we started to get through the clouds to the blue sky and we turned to see Mt Cook. It was great to finally see it and especially from the vantage point that we had. It did end up clearing that day anyway, but the views from the tarns were well worth it.

Wanaka was our next destination. We'd been here a few times but this time we wanted to do a few more of the walks in the area. Sadly one was closed but Robs Peak was still open. It was a pretty steep long walk, but nothing we hadn't done before. It gave some great views of Aspiring National Park, Cadrona Valley and Wanaka. It was a great 360 view point. Again our knees were stuffed, but we had done a fair bit this week.

After all this we are heading up the west coast next week. Only to do more walking, but also to take in some more glaciers and hot pools.
