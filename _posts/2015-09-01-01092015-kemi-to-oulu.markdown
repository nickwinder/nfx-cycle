A new month, and a new record distance. I didn't mean to go so far, but the riding was just nice..... And even easy! 

I have to praise the Finish for there cycle paths around the towns and villages. Very much like Sweden and Norway, with the single wide path for use of the pedestrians and bikes. No, this would not work in the UK, there are a lot less people around, maybe that's the reason it works. 

Most of the day I've been following route 4 but the eurovelo 10 guide keeps on throwing me down smaller roads just off the main road. Which is great because its super quiet and you get to weave all over the road. I did have to play miss a mole all day though. Similar to whack a mole, but you have to miss the holes with your wheel. The roads where mostly compressed mud/sand/gravel. Most were in good enough condition though.

So I was going to stop after 70km, but it was only 14:00 and I was just enjoying the riding. Oulu was only 35km away, so I went for it. The paths all the way into Oulu were great again, I think I clocked about 20km of dedicated cycle path into the centre. I skirted round the edge to get to the campsite. I'll go for a real look round tomorrow morning, but Oulu is looking super nice at the moment. Better than Kemi or Torino.

Also I made the best bike coffee holder in the world today. All you need is a rack and a rear light clip. It'll only work for those small cardboard cups, but still, the excitement!
