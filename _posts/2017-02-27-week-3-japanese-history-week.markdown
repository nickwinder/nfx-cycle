This week started up in Kobe. And the only reason I've heard about Kobe before is because of the beef.  But we were pretty happy to find out there was more than just beef.  We had originally planned to explore the place for one day and then head out to a castle in near by Hemji. But because we enjoyed Kobe the first day we decided to stick around and see a little more on the second day.

Both days we headed out for some fairly long walks. It's great to find trails that head up and out of the city into the hills of the surrounding areas.  This being said, the trails are very different to the New Zealand norm that we are used to.  Everywhere you still see the human influence, with concrete reinforce banks and metal fences stopping rock falls.  Still it was nice to get out of the city. Back in the city, it felt a little more western influenced.  There was architecture which had been directly copied from various places in Europe and the people seemed to be a little more laid back than that of the type in Tokyo for example.

We stayed at a AirBnB this time as we could not find any couch surfing hosts here. The place was advertised as the 'Ninja Room', so how could we not go for this one. It was a really cool studio type apartment, with everything we needed. And as always, a feature full toilet.

From Kobe we moved back to Kyoto for a long stint at a couch surfing host within the city. We were slightly apprehensive about this as we were staying 6 nights! I felt a little bad, but they did offer after we initially asked for 3 nights.  We hung around in Kobe for most of the travelling day so we did not arrive too early.  We even had time to try our first Txpresso. A tea esspresso. It was pretty weird and according to the barista, not even that popular. But you know, you've got to try these things.

Arriving back in Kyoto was pretty simple and after a long walk we got to the hosts flat. She was super friendly and as always very accommodating, even down to have a pair of slippers for us to wear as we walked in.  It was also back to the traditional Japanese way of sleeping on the floor.  I think we are both getting pretty used to it now, but we have no idea how the older generation do it.

We headed out on the first day to explore some of the older districts of Kyoto.  This is really what Kyoto is famous for, being the old capital before Tokyo.  This is also the first time we've seen a real touristy place, there are some many people visiting these areas even in winter. With plenty of people dressing up in kimonos and having pictures taken in front of the temples. The second day we went to the Kyoto Museum, which had some great historical ceramics and art from all periods throughout Japanese history. It really built a great picture of influences through the pass from China and the surrounding areas.  We also took a walk (or romantic scroll as some would say) down a quieter area of town, the path followed a canal system with the banks full of perfect vegetation and views over the city.  We both felt getting away from the busy Japanese city centre was a great relief, even if it was brief.

Day 3 we headed to a festival at a temple just out from the centre, there was lots of markets and a special tea ceremony held by the young geisha's (makio). And the real reason for the festival was for the blooming of the plumb blossoms.  Pretty touristy again but a good experience to see lots of the locals in their traditional dress and some odd characters also. Then we headed to the famous kinkaku-ji temple, which is a temple fully covered in gold foil.  This was certainly more spectacular than I thought it was going to be.  We got the sun light and timing exactly right, the gardens along with the temple gave some beautiful pictures.

Day 4 we had a great day out with our couch surfing hosts. For the morning we went to a all you can eat breakfast for 500 yen! But we forgot that breakfast here does not consist of what you think. It was still noddles, miso, stir-fried food.  It was all good, but a little funny for us in the morning. We then headed out to Fushimi inari shrine, which is actually lots of small shrines dotted all the way up the hills near by. But as you climb up the hill between the shrines there are torii (wooden/concrete archways) towering over the path. There are thousands of these and apparently go round for 4kms.  Next we went to a matcha tea house, which is a posh version of green tea essentially, they made all types of fancy matcha cakes, sweets and ice cream.  Everything seemed to be a take on green tea, red beans and sugar, with some huge nickabockaglory style ice cream dishes.  So good, but so sickly at the same time.  Whats better after this but to head to the brewery! So we had a beer zipped off to the imperial palace. Which was closed, but still the area around was a huge park, so we walked off all the sweets and beer.  Lastly we headed home because they offered to cook Teppanyaki style (a hot plate at the table), they served up a savoury style pancake (Okonomiyaki) with seafood.  We had so much our stomachs were bursting! It was a great day and we've really enjoyed our stay with these guys.

After all that, I don't think you really needed to read all that. You could've just looked at the pictures, they show the great parts of Japan.

Now we have our last day in Kyoto and then we are heading Nara, the old old capital of Japan. We'll see how that goes.
