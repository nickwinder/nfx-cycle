I thought it's about time that I should introduce you to my home for the trip. It's a little cramped and you'd struggle to swing a cat. But its enough. 

It's a small 2 man tent, well a small Nick and Ashley tent. I wouldn't like to bunk with Phil in here. Anyway, it gives me enough room for my camping mat and pannier bags down the side. After a few weeks now I've got it down to a tee. 

I use my clothes inside a dry sac as a pillow. I have to put my towel underneath this to make sure it doesn't slip away in the night. My second little tip is to trap a little bit of air in the dry sac to give the pillow a bit of a spongy effect. Although when the morning comes around, its usually seeped out. Still, it works at first.

The tent has pockets on either side of the inner liner. So in one side I have my torch and phone. And the other I have my wallet and passport. You always need to know what to grab when you're in a rush.

With my mat rolled out and my sleeping bag out. There is really only 2 full pannier bags left, so they live on the side with my clothes on for the next morning, or the night if its getting cold.

Lastly, always keep a bottle of water by your side. You never know when you need to spray your face with water.
