The wildlife woke me up sharp again this morning. Jumping around the trees, floor and tent. Yet again that stupid woodpecker. 

I road along what felt like a coast line, but really was a super big lake all the way to Tampere. A really nice quiet ride, but the wind was blowing in my face pretty bad. But this didn't seem to bother me too much today.

As I got nearer to Tampere I entered a super big park area just to the north east of the city. Mostly used for cross country skiing in the winter, it made for some nice biking trails and probably running trails. When I got near the end of this and into the city I started chatting to a guy riding past me. In the end he ended up taking me for a coffee and waffle in the old town area. It was a really nice gesture and a interesting chat. Anyway just as we were riding to the old town a big 'crash bang wallop' was heard. My rack bolt and snapped straight through, leaving my rack wedged into my brake disc. We managed to get some tie wraps on there to wedge it away from the disc, so at least I could ride carefully. But that's something I need to sort tomorrow.

After all this I headed to the warm showers host where I met his wife, where she offered that much needed shower. Having chatted to them both for a while now, they seem really nice and yet again so accomadating. I've managed to get my plans sorted out for tomorrow and they filled me with some lovely food.
