Yesterday, I decided to take a day off in Oulu, do a little sight seeing and have a rest in general. It turned out to be pretty good. I rode around the city a bit, went for a coffee and went to the Oulu history museum. So now I know a little more about the Finish history.

On the night I went to stay at another warm showers hosts. Yet again another super nice guy and his girl friend. It seemed these guys has just been traveling their whole life, and they seriously loved India, having been 8 times. 

Back to today. I set out a little later than normal, but I knew I had to do a fair distance, as I have to make it Himanka the day after. This should have been fine because, the landscape round here is flat. Seriously flat. Everything is starting to change, the trees are disappearing, farms are popping up everywhere.
For some reason I was not feeling it, feeling slightly under the weather and at 50km, I wanted to stop. I had no choice though, 100km it had to be.

I finally made it to the area I wanted to be at, and started looking for places to stop. I'd spotted a few fire shelters on the map, so I headed for these. A great place to stop, but there seems to be a lot of noisy muppets around. Bezzing around on stupid mopeds, or there little boat at 10:30pm. A bit disappointed to say the least. Arh well. Should be a good rest again tomorrow.
