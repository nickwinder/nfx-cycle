I decided not to have a big plan as I didn't want to make the same mistake as yesterday. So I just start riding, and it was so easy! No idea why, but I knocked out 20km without even trying. What was going on? I had a stupid crazy hard day yesterday and then this. 

I stopped for my breakfast and all came apparent, there was a lovely tail wind pushing me along. So I made the decision then that I was going to go for Kiruna as it looked like a fairly large town. 

Nothing much to report in terms of the scenery as its becoming more and more flat. But I did see my first wildlife. A bright and bushy fox, not like the ones you see in Manchester, and a reindeer! 

As for me, well I'm getting bitten to death and suddenly I got pretty sun burnt today. I don't know why it hasn't effected me the other days, but now I'm a little sore......
