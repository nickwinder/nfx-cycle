One thing driving me today, was the fact that at the end of the day I would get a shower. 7 days since my last one. Pretty stinky. I was heading for Porvoo where I'd organised to stay at a WS host and I couldn't wait to get there. 

I still felt fairly bad today, so I didn't want to push too much. I also had a good dosage of vegetables in the morning. The route took me off the main roads again and on the gravel tracks. This was nice, quiet and back to that relaxing way of riding again.

I went through some nicer costal towns today. They seemed to have kept a bit more of the history, maybe at a sacrifice of jobs though. 

I've just had a great meal at the WS, and we are just waiting on two more cyclists coming in. So it may be a eventful none sleeping night. We shall see. 

Just in case the first sign wasn't clear enough.
