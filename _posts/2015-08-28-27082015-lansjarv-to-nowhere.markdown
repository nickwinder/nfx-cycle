This morning I had a rude awakening at 4:30. Some wild form decided to start sniffing around my bike and bags. What it didn't know, it was boobie trapped. Nothing could be moved without making a rattle. Crash bang wallop, it woke me up and galloped away. So that was me layed there for an hour wondering what on earth it could be.

AnotherÂ uneventful transition day. I had to get far enough to get to LuleÃ¥ tomorrow. And also storms are forcast overnight and into the morning, along with winds right in my face. So the shorter the better tomorrow. 

The other real highlight was meeting another tourer at last. I finally turned off the E10 road!!! I've been on it since Narvik. And as soon as I did, I found another biker. He was a Estonian guy with half decent English. Thinking back now, I should have asked where from/details to get a free night there. Oppps.
