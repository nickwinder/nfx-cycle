Setting off this morning was a little tough, I'm feeling at the moment I need a full week off. But still over a week and half until Ashley arrives I'll have to wait it out. But I can't wait. So I've decided to head to Lahti , where a friend of mine is staying and then from there I'll take a check on time and see if it would be possible to get out to the Russian boarder. From different sources I've been reading, it seems this is the place to cycle along with the south coast, a route called the kings road. 

I wanted to get a fair distance done today, so it gave me 2 easy days into Lahti. So setting off early when the warm shower hosts went to work certainly helped. I was heading for another national park. Yes it's full of lakes and trees again, its Finland. 

Again there was a fair wind, with this it seems the weather is turning. The clouds are coming over and we are expecting rain soon. Arh well.

Everything today seemed to happen after 4pm. First thing

I saw a MOOSE!!!!!!!!! It was massive, and a little intimidating. I frantically tried to get my phone out, but my super skid startled it. So glad I have finally seen one though!! 

Where I saw the moose was on a road heading into the national park. It was an appalling road. They'd just put new stones down and it dangerous as anything for the bike. Sliding side ways continuously. Luckily a guy with a trailer came passed and saw I was struggling. He offered a lift which was great. He took me to the spot I was thinking of camping but it still means I have 15km of it in the morning. Also I kinda wanted to get out the car. He offered to let me camp at his summer house, but he already stank of booze and had a 12 pack in the front of the car. I took a quick guess and assumed we may struggle to get on. Even if he managed to keep the car on the road.

So lastly, I had a hell of a hike to get into the camping spot I wanted. In the end I had to stash the bike and it was just not passable. Which did mean I had to do 2 trips with all my stuff. So we can add 9km of waking into today's total. When I got to the site I was done for. I was staggering on the trail and my brain was just not working. So I scoffed some chocolate raisins I'd bought and a apen bar. And that got me through the next 30 mins until I could cook something up. 

I also decided to try a alterative way of putting up my tent tonight. See the picture.
