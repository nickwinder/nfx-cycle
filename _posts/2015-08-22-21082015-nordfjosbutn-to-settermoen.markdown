I started the day off early just to make sure no one saw me on the beach (and not to get flooded out by the incoming tide). Just had a few nibbles and I was off. Today, I was heading for as close to Narvik as I could get so I would be able to cross into Sweden tomorrow. Easier said than done though, its quite a way. 

My route was mainly following the number 10 cycle route, in Norway, that basically means follow the road.... It's still super busy with lots of lorries passing by. It'll be a bit of a sigh of relief when I get on those long straight roads. 

I met two cycle tourers on the way. 2 fifty year olds from the Netherlands who had been traveling up to alta for a long time. They gave me a few tips and they were on their way. 

The views are still stunning. It's seems the mountains are a little further apart now, but still pretty huge. 

I can see a theme to my blogs developing, feel free to skip to the maps. :)

As for camp, I was looking at a campsite again, but I went passed and had a little look. But it seemed rather unappealing. So I carried on, and guess what, it paid off again. I found a beautiful spot by a large river. It seems like a few people use this spot, but I'm here first! I've just had a good wash in the river, but it's so hot I'm sweating again already.
