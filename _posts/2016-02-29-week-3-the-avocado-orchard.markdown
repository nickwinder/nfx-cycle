To start this week, we were doing our last bit of tourist stuff up north. A trip down 90 mile beach. This perfect unbroken beach that actually runs for 55 miles (88km), which is also a national highway! Before you think it though, we are not stupid enough to take our camper on there. We booked a tour which took us all the way to Cape Reinga and then travelled all the way back down 90 mile beach. Is was good fun and saved our wheels a pointless 200km trip.

The rest of the week has been taken up by working on a small avocado orchard. We found this through work away and they happened to need a little help this week. We ended up doing a bit of gardening and painting, but we did get to do some picking also. 

It is a fairly small Orchard, mainly focused on growing there own food. Every meal we ate had some type of home grown food on there. And yes, we intentionally overdosed on avocados. We were staying in their little barn conversion which gave some nice privacy and comfort to allow us to get sorted and decide what we wanted to do next. 

The one day trip we had was climbing Mt Manaia, which is out along a headland in the midst of some great formations and spectacular views. It's not the largest of hills and only took us 45 minutes to walk up. So we decided we could run down! This was pretty tough as most of the trail was lined with stairs. No one fell this time.

Next week we are travelling back south. Stopping by our friends and passing though Auckland again. Then on to the unknown!
