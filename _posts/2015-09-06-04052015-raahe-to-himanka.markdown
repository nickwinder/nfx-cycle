Yet again, I woke up to nice sunny weather. It really is amazing how lucky I've been with the sun shine and my beautiful tan lines are a tell tail sign for it. I didn't stick around too long, because I wanted to get to the next WS (warm showers). I'd be stay 2 nights at the next place, so a nice rest will be deserved after a long days ride.

I differed from the route suggested on the eurovelo 10. This was a suggestion from WS guy, to see the real Finland. Apart from the odd wooded area every now and then. The golden arable fields reminded me of east Yorkshire. Pan flat and tractors and combines everywhere. Pretty scary on small roads..... 

There was a little rain towards the end of the day, but nothing to complain about. WS guy came out to meet me a few km out of Himanka to guide me in, which was great as I was really feeling it at that point. 

We got back to the house and they've been great hosts. I feel like I should be helping more really. I got in and the sauna was already warmed up for me, with vodka waiting on the kitchen side for my consumption. This was all followed up with a great chicken and salad dinner. A great amount of luxury I had not been used to for the past 2 weeks. Now for a rest in a real bed! Let's see if I get up in the morning for a little bit of boating in the sea..........

Ant fight.......
