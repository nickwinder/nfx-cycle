It was a chilly wet morning in my cramped camping space, so I tried to stick around and let the tent dry out a little. I had some breakfast there in another little compartment I made. I had a bedroom, garage and now a kitchen. 
Then a few minutes later a hunter came traipsing through my house. No idea where he was off, he left his dogs in the car. I think he just wanted the toilet, got embarrassed because he saw me so had to keep walking. 

The ride was not too far today, so I took a super long stop in AlajÃ¤rvi, it was nice to have a relaxed day on the bike. The terrains been very similar again, with the inclusion of even more lakes. 

The best part of the day was the camping spot. I hunted around a lot for this one. And in the end, some helpful local maps at the side of the road directed me to a fire pit/bunk house. The bunk house had been turned into a sauna, surprise surprise. But the fire pit + more was there. So I decided to have a small fire tonight and make use of the Finnish wood.
