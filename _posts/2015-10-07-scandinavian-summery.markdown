With just under 2500km done and 170 hours of riding I have finished my leg in Scandinavia. It proved to be a great place for a cycle tour and if you are willing to rough it, it's not as expensive as everyone makes it out to be. 

Norway : this is certainly one place I will be returning to. I would love to follow the coastal route as the scenery in the north was so spectacular, I can only imagine it gets better. Wild camping proved to be OK, but you had to be a little inventive. The coast seemed to be a bit over populated. If you follow the main cycle route there were a fair few campsites , but you have to be willing to pay for it. 

Sweden : I do not feel I got a true representation of Sweden due to me being so far north. The north eastern areas were beautiful and very remote, you could really lose your self in the forests up there, but as for roads, you don't have much choice. Major roads it is. It was certainly good that I saw Lulea, as I think this gives me a idea of what Sweden is more about. But I wouldn't trade the emptiness and the ability to pitch a tent almost anywhere for that. 

Finland : this is where I spent most of my time. I think it may be nearly 4 weeks there. I feel like I got to know the place pretty well, the good and some of the bad. I would say the northern towns and cities seem to be suffering a bit. Similar to the problem in the UK, Oulu did seem nice, but from what I heard there still huge unemployment there. As I think we all know, you have to used to lakes and trees, I can confirm there is a lot of them. This made cycling a little boring some days and I was longing for something else to look at. One thing that is a massive positive for Finland and touring is the laavu's and camp areas. Completely free and your nearly guaranteed wood to make a fire a keep yourself warm. It makes choosing a place to camp really easy and takes a lot of the wild camping anxiety away. A negative point is the drinking and unemployment problem. I hardly saw any homeless in Finland, but the amount of drunks I saw was a little unnerving. Me and Ashley even started playing a game of drunk or not in Helsinki. All in all, I would say Finland is not a bad place for touring, but I would suggest other places before it.
