On a mission to do a good distance today, I set off as early possible. I had to get back into the morning routine of cooking and packing away, which was strange after a week of lazy mornings. 

I feel today was more like the first day riding in real Estonia and as it happens, my last. During the beginning the landscape was some of the flattest I'd ever seen, mainly lined with farms along the way.

Even heading through the smaller towns and villages you can still see the horrible concrete soviet buildings, which certainly ruin the view. There is a little more history here though, with a few ruins scattered here and there, some sites dating back to the 1200's.

I was chased by a dog for the first time today. The method of defence this time was to bark back at the dog, it seem to work although it may have been the busy road that scared it off. I've also spotted an unleashed dog a few hundred metres up the road, so I'm ready for a fight tomorrow morning. 

I just entered into a few rolling hills now, nothing too big though. So it may get more interesting entering Latvia tomorrow. Wednesday I will be in Riga, with a bit of time during the afternoon to hopefully have a good luck around. I've still got my fingers crossed for a WS host there.
