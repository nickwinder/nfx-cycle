I set out from Ashley's flat in Manchester at 9am. Riding to the airport has got to be one of the best ways possible. You don't have to worry about taxis, public transport, just your legs and your bike. 
A pretty emotional goodbye was quickly replaced with the thoughts of 'Jesus this bike is heavy'. It seems the rear aluminium rack is flexing a bit. So if you sway the bike at all, you get a fair wobble on. Hopefully a bit of weight balancing could sort this. I'm guessing the 5 books ain't helping. :) 
I used Google navigation to get there, which is a bit of a luxury compared to what I'm facing, but there's not too many roads in Scandinavian is there?

I had a little trouble getting the bike on the plane and had to pay Â£50 more for it (I thought it was included), so getting there 2 hours before really helped. Not having to strip the bike down seems great as it didn't take long at the airport and I've seen a few bike boxes thrown around already. 

We were delayed getting into olso, which meant full on panic stations. Apparently , because my transfer is internal you have to pick your luggage up and check it in again. It wasn't too bad but the bike and the kit is really awkward to carry round, plus i had 40 mins to do all that and get to the gate. I ran through the airport only to find that the next flight was delayed anyway. Whats the rush....... 

I got into Tromso and straight away the mountains were there. It looks great, and even Tromso is a little hilly! So I set too and started sort my bike and things, only to find it happened. My bike got damaged. It was only the plastic smashed off the hoods, but still annoying. Luckily it all still worked so I could ride out and get to the airbnb place I was staying.

Tomorrow calls for the first riding day, but I have to pick up some gas and insect repellent before I go. I'm also worried about food, so I'm going to carry as much as possible.
