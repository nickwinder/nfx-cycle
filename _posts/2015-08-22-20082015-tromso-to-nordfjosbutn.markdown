I had to start the day out with some last minute purchases, but I decided to have a lie in because I'd been kept up a bit of the night. Someone was cooking at 2:30am!?!?Ã‚  And the kitchen was right outside my door. 

I managed to get everything I needed and set off around 12. With the addition of water and food, the bikes now even heavier, at an estimation I'd say 13kg for the bike, 35-40kg for the stuff I'm carrying and then me! So that's pretty hefty.

Onto the ride. It's surprising how populated this area is, there's not been many stretches of road that do not have houses on, which is leading me to believe it could be difficult camping. 
Some of the views are amazing though. The mountains are getting bigger and bigger and the sea keeps splitting them to create great landscapes.

I decided I wanted to stop and I saw that there was camping 20km ahead, seen as it was my first night and it was so populated in the area I went for it. Only to find that they did not accept tents! So I was out of luck and had to turn to my urban camping roots. I did find a picnic area not to far on and decided to eat and get a wash in the stream bear by. But I decided it was far to busy for my liking, so I pressed on. There were so many nice spots, but they were all owned and had boat houses on, so I had to keep looking, luckily I found a little passage leading down to the sea and it seemed no one really owned the land. Or if they did , they did not care. So I went for it, I pitched up in a tiny spot just above the shore line. It has such a good view, now I'm just watching fish jumping out the water.......
