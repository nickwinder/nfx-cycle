After a long 10 hour sleep, you'd expect I'd be wide awake and ready to get moving. It seemed that this wasn't the case. I'm not entirely sure what had come over me but I was really lacking in energy. I popped to the shop near by to get some fruit and pasta down me, thinking I just needed food. This wasnt the case either. 

I set off on the bike, knowing that I didn't need to go far at all today. It hardly felt like I was pushing the pedals round and at every opportunity I was free wheeling. Anyway on I went and got to the next town called Vaala. I saw a laavu not to far from the town, so I decided I could rest there all day and see if anyone turned up on the evening. If not of sleep there.

Also a man asked me this morning if I'd spotted 2 dogs on the run. Apparently Irish wolf hounds. I kinda laughed because I thought he was having me on and trying to scare me. He didn't look too pleased about that. 

I was remaindered today by some wonderful individual that I'd been on the road for a month today. So I've included a quick screen shot of the stats. I think it's a good amount for the month.
