I crossed the boarder! And I didn't even realise. But first the ride. 

It was another long one today, I wanted to cross the boarder because I had no Swedish money left, well I no have 1 krona... Any body want a penny sweet. I set out early, oh yeah I didn't get shot during the night, which was good. But yeah I set out early and made it to Kalix in good time. I found a bit of WiFi courtesy of the Swedish bank, and sorted my usual updates. After carrying on I was thinking there was only 40km to do. There was a complete miss calculation there, it was more like 65km, oppppsss. But it was nice as I've just downloaded some podcasts to listen to on the move. It really helps on those long stretches. 

20km of the ride was on a gravel road, which made it hard going, but it was really nice and peaceful.

As I said at the start, I didn't even know I'd crossed the boarder. One side there was IKEA (no joke) the other side I can only assume the Ikea's arch nemesis. I should have guessed really. 
So now for rest. I really need it, my legs are starting to give out, as well as my knees and one wrist. I think I need a bath is some anti inflammatory liquid.
