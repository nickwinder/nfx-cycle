Happy birthday to me. Yes it's my birthday, that's enough about that.

Nothing much to report today after the excitement of yesterday. Even though the mountains were hard, I'm really starting to miss the views. So let's hope Finland brings something different.

The most exciting thing about the day is the camping spot I found. It was a complete fluke of just wondering off the main road and randomly following campervans (still not sure where they went). There was a sign post for swimming and camping, it was a little off the beaten track but I went to explore anyway. It turned out to be beautiful lake beach with no one around. Guessing the locals don't want people to know about it. So I've just been for a skinny dip/wash.

That's about it, it should be 2 days to LuleÃ¥ now. I've emailed a person on warm showers to see if I could stay the night. I'm hoping he's got a nice bed and shower because I need a rest......

Oh and Swedish service stops do make me laugh.
