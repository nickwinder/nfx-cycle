This week started with our final day in Kyoto. We were planning on going to Himeji castle, but we decided to put it off until the next day as we had a lot of time between couch surfing hosts. So we didn't end up doing too much, just the standard coffee shop (no I've still not found a good one here!), a bite to eat and a walk around the city. I now have a new favourite sweet also, we think it is called Moji. As with every other sweet here it is made of rice, and sweet red beans. But the one I like has green tea mixed into the rice mush stuff. The picture explains it a little better.

For our next day we headed to Nara for a few days, but as we couldn't go to the couch surfing hosts until 6pm, we decided to take the train to Himeji. This is the place of one of the best castles in Japan, painted in a bright white it stands tall above the city. It certainly is spectacular. As with most of the historic places in Japan it has been renovated, but it is still based from original plans even down to the types of wood they used for the huge 25m tree trunk pillars.
As we walked in the gates, there was a friendly Japanese man offering free English tours around the castle and as we'd had a good experience in the past with the free tours we decided to take him up on the offer. He took Ashley and I round pointing out some of the significant features of the castle and teaching us of the history of ownership. This was pretty complicated and there was no way I was going to remember, but it was nice to pretend.

Not realising that we would not have as much time as we wanted we had to rush back to the train to make our connection to Nara. We pretty much spent 5 hours on the train that day and we were ready to relax somewhere. We headed over to the couch surfing hosts for the night and we were greeted with a cooked dinner as soon as we walked in the door. This time we were staying with an older couple, conversation was very easy as they lived in the UK for 4 years, which also gave us a good talking point.

We had just 2 full days in Nara, which seemed as it would be enough as it was one of the smaller cities of the area. It is where the originally capital of Japan was created, therefore there was lots of places and history to see. In the morning we had to head out early with the host as they went to work, so this called for a nice 8am stroll into the city, passing by a few shrines and a huge mound in the middle of a moat. This tree covered hill was a burial mound for one of the previous emperors of Japan. On we headed into town and up towards the park with most of the shrines and temples, plus the hundreds of tame deer that you can feed, pretty weird. But guess what...... a man approached us offering a free English tour. These tours are truly free and not like the ones you find in Europe. On there little ID passes it explains that they will not accept any donations. The guys always seem to be older and in retirement age, also they are always trying to practice and improve their English. I guess that they are paid something by local tourist funding, but we are really not sure.
The kind man took us through all that there was to see in the area (which seemed like a lot) and proceeded to walk us around a small pond and talking about it's usage in religious ceremonies. A couple of pictures and off we headed to our first shrine where he spent maybe an hour explaining the ins and outs of Buddhism. At this point we realised it was going to be a long day. After spending 3 hours talking, walking and trying to understand the history, he suggested we may need to eat. As it was nearly 2pm he was right. He offered to take us to a nice restaurant with good traditional Japanese food and plenty of tea. For 800 yen we got a good feed, of raw fish, soups and fried prawns/vegetables. He was right, it was pretty good.
We headed round more of his highlights and over towards the finale of the day. The biggest Buddha in Japan. It was huge! And probably one of the first times I've truly said wow in Japan. To give you perspective the nose was 1 meter high Made from bronze it was first created in the 700's, but it has suffered a few times since then. Apparently it's head fell off in an earth quake. The current one had been standing there since the 1600's which is still pretty amazing. It was also surrounded by other equally amazing statues and housed it the biggest temple we'd seen yet. It happens to be the biggest wooden building in the world. One place I would recommend to people going to Japan. Our last tip from our tour guide after spending the full day with him was ceremony that was taking place during our stay. It was a ceremony that had been taking place since 752 and never missed a year! So we decided to catch it the next day.

On our second day in Nara it was a bit drizzly so we decided to head to the museums and generally stay indoors. As we were heading towards the museum a man handing out leaflets told us about a free tea ceremony and other events going on in the tourist centre that day. So we waited around for a bit and headed over that way. When we got there we were rushed up stairs to a room with full of business men in suits. We were all sat around listening to some music played by a woman on a Koto. It was a really interesting instrument and created some great sounds. Being 2 of maybe only 6-8 tourists in the room, we later found out it was event for the opening of a new hotel in the area. We are guessing the only reason we were invited along was for the pictures of white faces in this great new hotel. It was pretty fun though, so we can't complain. After the music we were invited to make some Moji! They brought out a huge hammer and a bowl of rice. Apparently they just smash the rice up with a huge hammer, it was pretty funny and also tricky ensuring that you did not hit the guy wetting the rice with his hands. Lastly we headed for a tea ceremony. We had more sweets then learnt the correct way to present ourselves when receiving and drinking the tea. We were pretty lucky to find this, all for free as well!

We did still head to the museum, which held some of the old Buddhist statues throughout the years. Some from way back in the 1st and 2nd century. The condition of the pieces are unreal and also unrivalled in the west. Sorry no pictures were allowed in the museum though.

Next we were heading to Osaka. After another early start and thanking the hosts for a great stay in Nara, we caught the train to Osaka. This time we could not find any couch surfing host, so we booked a Airbnb for a few nights. This was a welcome change, just so we could have some quite time and turn our brains off. Sadly the Airbnb was not ready when we got there, so we had to hang around for ages for them to sort the room out. So much for paying for accommodation. It pretty much wasted the day and we got nothing done.

We'd been looking for things to do in Osaka, but nothing much popped up. So we took the subway over to big park to do a little running. When we got there it was obvious that everyone else does this on Saturday mornings also. The 2.5Km loop track was packed with people, but it was still pretty enjoyable. After our run we hung around for a bit because there was a race on, we think it was a 10K relay race, but we're not really sure because people seemed to be running multiple times. Good to see though. We headed back to the Airbnb for a quick lunch then back out into Osaka city. Safe to say it's big, and busy! Being lost in all the people most the time, we didn't really enjoy the city too much. We headed round the castle to catch some views and ran into massive crowds of teenagers on the way to a gig. "Back Number" Yey! Then over to the shopping district to seem the famous illuminations.

Now we're all excited about going to Hokkaido and seeing the mountains and riding some deep powder! It should be a good week.
