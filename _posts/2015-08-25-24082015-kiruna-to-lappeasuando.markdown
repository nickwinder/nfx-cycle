I decided to have a lazy morning seen as the last 2 days have been a bit hectic. So I went into the town centre (well what there was of it) and had wonder round. In the end I just went to the super market really. 

I went back up to the camp site but I felt really drained and a bit of a headache coming on, so I down about a litre of water went back to my tent for a quick sleep. After that I was right as rain, apart from weeing a lot. 

So I had a little to eat and set out at 12:30 at a nice slow pace. It was plain sail all the way up to road works, which went on for 14km! If I wasn't confident in my bike before, this certainly stress tested it for me.Ã‚  All of it a bumpy temporary surface, I ended being beeped by a motorcyclist, so I waved him on to let him passed but he just kept beeping. I stopped and he pulled up beside me to tell me that I'd drop my vest. It was drying off the side of the panniers. 

I got 45k in, which is where I saw a parking icon on the map that may have been good enough to sleep at. But it turned out to be one of the worst I've seen here. Like a truckers stop, unlike the caravan stops I'd seen before. So carried on to the next one which looks OK. By the side of a river with a few caravans around, so this will do before the next town tomorrow.
