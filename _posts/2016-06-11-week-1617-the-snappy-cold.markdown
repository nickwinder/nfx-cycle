So the cold has finally hit. It's been pretty chilly as of late and the mountains are ripe for riding. But no wait, apparently that's not how it works here.  Suddenly a warm English Autumn day comes our way, and washes away all the snow! Nooo Whyyyy! So that has put a dampener on the opening of the first ski hills. 

Not too much to report from the last two weeks. I managed to acquire 3 snowboards in one day. This does mean that I have ended up only spending $80 on a board! Not bad, although the core shot means it's not perfect, but I would argue the hills aren't perfect, so who cares. 
We went to Banff film festival, which as always is enthralling and inspiring. It introduced me to a ..... sport? .... touring style ... I'd never seen before. Paraglide touring. These guys only travelled via paraglides, covering 100km a day in the air, travelling from thermal to thermal. Pretty amazing way of seeing the landscape but not something you'll catch me doing too quick.

Other than that, here are some funny pictures.

Next week is snowboarding week! Can't wait.
