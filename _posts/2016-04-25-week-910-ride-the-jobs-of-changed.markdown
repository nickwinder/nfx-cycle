A lot has changed since the last update. We have changed location and jobs. We are also primed to move into a house share. 

First, we had the last of the grape picking. We worked solid for 10 days to get all the grapes in. And in this time Ashley was darting to Queenstown for waitress training and work. It's certainly been a busy one. At the end of harvest we had a great celebration with the whole crew, lots of food and wine/beer was had. It certainly topped off a enjoyable 3 weeks.

Now we are in Queenstown. I have a job at a running shop and Ashley is working as a waitress. We managed to get our jobs pretty quick but the accommodation proved to be a little harder to find.  Another stroke of luck put us onto a house sit which bought us a extra week to find a flat. With this house sit comes consequences though. We had to do a little bit of cleaning which wasn't a problem, but we also had to look after a cat. Not something both of us are keen on. It complains for food constantly and gives you the crazy stare, then wakes you up at 6 in the morning. But still, it is a free place to stay in a beautiful area.

Renting in this area is a little difficult and expensive. I've never been in a place where housing is in such short supply that you have to take whatever is on the table. Sadly this means we will not be able to save as much as we'd hoped, but we are in a remarkable area with plenty of skiing and snowboarding!

Next week we'll be moving into a new place and hoping all works out well. Hopefully we can settle into some type of routine and get out and see more things.
