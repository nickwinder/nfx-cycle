Let's start by saying, it was bitterly cold this morning! It must have been below 0 as I put my camp mat out to dry (no idea how it got wet) and it started to freeze. I must say I wasn't ready for this, I knew it was cold as I was up most of the morning trying to find things to throw on top of me to warm me up.

When I got out the tent, it did look beautiful and I tried to remind myself this is the reason why I am here. The sun had just come up and was reflecting off the frost in the field. But there was no tricking my brain. My fingers were numb until 11am this morning, making it difficult to make breakfast. It doesn't look like its going to let up for the next two weeks.

I hit the Latvian boarder fairly early, which felt like a mini achievement. I crossed a country in 3 days. There was not too much of a difference as you would expect, but there seems to be less horrible buildings here. I was back on the cycle route again so I think the villages have had some investment put into them. And you can tell. Pretty parks and public buildings and the general state of the towns was good. 

Then general route apart from one road was fairly good, the roads were kept in good condition and there wasn't a lot of heavy traffic.

Now for the bad part. I think I'm done. I've been fighting in my head all day, trying to find reasons to stop, and reasons to keep going. But by the fact that I'm questioning it means there's something wrong. I don't see the point of wasting my time and money if I'm not enjoying it. The cold, unappealing route, and loneliness is certainly the main factors. So I'm going to get to Riga tomorrow and spend a few days there and work something out. I have a few ideas but we will see.
