This week was bound not to be as exciting as last week. No mountains to climb, no volcanos to see.  

Reflecting on the money we have spent, we had been contemplating between stopping to work somewhere or carrying on until winter. It was a difficult decision, as we still had a little bit of backup money, but it dawned on us that all the seasonal picking jobs were available. Right now.  Our other idea was to head down to Wellington and try to find some work there as we'd heard it was a nice place. 

We set off south from Lake Taupo , passing by the fantastic volcanos once again but only to know it would probably be the last time we were seeing the towering peaks of the North Island. Our journey took us through some interesting barren, rugged land. Nice to look at but not much happening, apart from this shoe fence......

The rest of the way down was fairly standard, nothing to shout about. We headed into Wellington, the first city we'd been in for a while, but I hesitate to call it a city. It's pretty small, just the right size I would say. We spent our time perusing the Te Papa museum, doing a bit of job hunting in the Library, eating sushi and drinking great coffee.

After all this we are on the move to the Queenstown area. Ok, thats a bit further than we were looking at going, but a contact I had kindly offered a bit of work, and we know we wanted to be in that area all along, so why not now.

Next week we will be mainly picking grapes. So I'm sure there's not much to tell, but there may be a few photos of the trip down the south.
