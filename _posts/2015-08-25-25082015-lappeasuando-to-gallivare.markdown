Early get up today, no reason, just woke up early. Excited for the day ahead of me, stay tuned for squirrel gate and crazy old man takes me everywhere. 

I spotted a bike and a tent in the distance, so I decided to stop and make breakfast, that way I could wait around to see which way they were going.... Not in a stalker way. I waited around until 8:50ish and still no movement, I bailed, I would make a poor stalker. 
During this time though I had a fight with a squirrel. The Iittle ginger thing was not scared of me at all, and I know it wanted my pecans in my bag. I kept kicking stones at it, but then a surprise attack!!!!! It tried to deceive me by darting round the back of the bushes...... But I was equal to it. Stones were flying its way. Now the problem came when I had to wash my pots from breakfast. Do I stay and defend or be safe in knowledge that I'd marked my territory. I went, safe to say it didn't give a poo (censored), it was all over my bag. Lucky for me squirrels do not have opposable thumbs, so it could not open the zips. Ha ha, foiled again. Enough of that story.

I met an old man. Lars ....something in Swedish..Â  He was cycling along with me and we were chatting about the area. It was very interesting, he told me all about the mines, the hunting seasons and then he suggested we nip to the local cafe. It was pretty cute. The building was a old school hall which he had done lots of work on (pretty sure he's the local Mafia by now). He got the woman there to make me a sandwich and a coffee and we chatted some more. He told the woman I didn't have to pay and we were off. (Certain he's the local Mafia now) 
We cycled a little further and he said let's go see the house I grew up in, his son lives there now. At this point in starting to get worried, but really what can a 66 year old man do. We got there and it was a house....... He talked to his son and we left, a little strange but a nice thought. We cycled on further and he dropped me on the climbs, pretty fit for an old man. And then his time had come he had to turn round to go and collect wood. 
After all he was just a super nice old man, it certainly made the day much nicer.

Now I'm at GÃ¤llivare (I need Ronny to help me say this), its a nice mining town. A bit nicer than Kiruna, it seems like it has a little more history. Had a look round the museum, but I've no idea what it was about. 

Alls good, just relaxing out of the sun, because it's far too warm for my silly skin now. I've decided to make today my birthday, so I've got 2 beers chilling in the fridge. And no it wasn't expensive, what are people on about. Â£1.20ish for a porter, we'll see how it tastes. 

Hope you enjoyed the stories. :)
