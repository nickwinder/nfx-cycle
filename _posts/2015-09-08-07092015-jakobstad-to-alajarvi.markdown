We had to get up early today, because the WS host was starting her new job. Safe to say, she seemed a tad nervous, as anyone would. This meant I was on the road by 7:30am.
We had a chat in the morning about routes and she convinced me that it would be better to go back towards central Finland, as then I could pass by some of the national parks and also keep away from that dreaded wind. 

So I've started heading inland, but this has brought me to a realisation. I'm going to be at Helsinki far to early.Â  Like 2 weeks early. So I'm frantically looking around the map to see what I can fill my time with. So if anyone has any grand suggestions for the area give me a shout (must be cheap). 

I've been surprised still how populated Finland has been. As I've been traveling inland there is still lots of people around with farms everywhere. This means the roads are still a little busy. Hopefully I will find some more quieter areas soon. 

As its busy around here, I've really had to cramp my tent in tonight. Maybe a even smaller tent is needed. :)
