This week is all about snow!! We went boarding in Hokkido!

We were off to meet Ash and Bee, who've been working there for the season, and the pictures have been looking great. It certainly didn't disappoint.

We had a quick flight from Osaka to Sapporo and then a journey on the train to Kutchan, which all ended up being around 12 hours.  But finally we were surrounded by snow!

I'm not sure what else to talk about here really, because we were boarding most of the time.  It snowed constantly for 2 days, which brought 40cm+ into most areas of the resort. Ash and Bee did take us out some of the control gates for some back country skiing.  This is what Japan powder is all about, it was so deep, every turn you blinded yourself with snow. There's not too many pictures because we were having such a good time.

We stopped in Sapporo for a night on the way back through just to see if the city had much to offer. But we found there was not much going on, apart from the famous Sapporo brewery, we had a few beers, but they all ended up being stupid lagers.

After this we just have a couple of days in Tokyo and then we are in Thailand. So big changes are coming.
