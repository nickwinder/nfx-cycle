I realised I over estimated the hike a little yesterday, still carrying everything on my back/head/shoulders made me twice as heavy. It was bound to be hard.

The sleep was so good. I slept for 10 hours last night, when I could barely sleep in Tampere. Maybe I'm just getting used to nature.

After hiking out in the pouring rain I decided to run in at the little cafe in the car park. Only to find myself in the middle of a OAP bus tour group. Not quite knowing what was going on I asked if any of them spoke English and they just pointed to the serving hatch. I think they knew what I needed. It was a pretty funny situation though. I found out the the hut was also a bunk house, which would have helped last night.

I hung around for about an hour but the rain wasn't stopping. So I just went for it, if you remember from yesterday post I was on a horrendously graveled road and I had another 15km of it to do. I had a few scary moments where I had to ride into the ditch but I made if in the end.

After all of that though I was so tired. Even thought I had a noddle stop half way through, so I got to a town and stuffed myself. It was 13:00 , I was knackered and I'd done 17km. It certainly didn't feel right.

I decided to get to the nearest laavu (see picture , I now know the name for them) I could. This was about 35km away, also the route tried to take me off the main road, but I wasn't going to risk losing the smooth tarmac again. I just put my head done and cycled.

I've just cooked my first meal on a camp fire. It took me a good hour to get a good fire to cook on. I think I need to go to scouts fire making lessons again. It was edible. :)
