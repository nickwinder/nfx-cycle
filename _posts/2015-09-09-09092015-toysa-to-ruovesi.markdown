Today I wanted to get close to the national park so I can chill tomorrow then so a bit of running over the next few days. So an early start was in order. 

I was heading for route 66! OK maybe not as famous as the American one, but it seemed like the road to be on. It brushes by HelvetinjÃ¤rvi National Park so I decide to find a town near by and get to a campsite to prepare. 

We are certainly getting to the Finland I expected to see. Much more water and slightly up and down. It makes the landscape a little more exciting better to ride. 

I've just clocked over 1000 miles for this trip, which sounds pretty good for just under 3 weeks. But in a bad note, it looks like my dynamo charger has died. So I'll have to try and sort that in Helsinki. 

Nothing much more to report, but I have one question for you Scandinavians. What on earth is the shower head in the toilets for?
