We landed on 4th February under a rather unexpected hot sun. I was sweating within a few seconds of being outside and my frail English skin was shouting no more! Apparently this is what we have to get used to in the north Island.Â 

We headed to a couch surfing place to get settled and do all those important tasks that you need to do when you move to a country. The guy that took us in was so generous, he took us round to car lots as soon as we got there. The next day he even took us to the bank and let us use his address to set up a bank account. Not having an address is one of the most limiting factors when moving elsewhere, as we've found with nearly every service we've had to sign up for.

As we were looking around for campers, our requirements seemed to go up and up. We start off wanting a van with a little room to cook and sit in etc. Then we quickly moved to a camper which was certified self contained, with low mileage, which is bigger enough to live in when the weather is bad. With our budget in mind we would have to compromise with some of those points.Â 

â€¢_Certified Self contained is something needed to stay at most the free campsites and generally freedom camp. It requires for you to carry a large enough water source, a toilet (which we will never use), waste water containment and believe or not, a bin._
_â€¢_Low mileage seems to be a struggle in this country. The vehicles seemed to have crazy mileage on them, but everyone assures us that this is the norm in NZ and do not compare to the UK.__

Onto the next free place to stay, but this time we have to work for it. We had a late email from a woman who wanted help with a few general house jobs, we found her on workaway, a service we hope to be using a few times. The jobs consisted of mainly gardening, but we also did a little bit of painting and house work. We were planning on staying there until we found a van, and at that point we will speed (at a slow pace) off into the distance.Â

We had seen a van that we quite liked a couple of days previous, yes it had 300 000Km on the clock, and it's a little small. But like I said we had to comprise somewhere. Sadly these guys were leaving very soon and we didn't have the money through from our international bank accounts yet, so we had to forget about it.

A couple of days later the guys got back to us saying they had an idea. Essentially they were going to leave the van with a couple from Auckland and we could go and pick it up and pay for it when we had money. This was perfect for us, no more looking around. It was starting to get a bit annoying.Â 

So it was a waiting game, one we would hope that would end fairly soon. It didn't help that it was a bank holiday in NZ. With all fingers crossed, it came in very quick and we were able to get on our way on the 11th February. So it took exactly a week to get set up here and buy a van to run away in.Â

We headed north with not too many plans, but we headed for the first marked free camp spot. It seemed like the logical thing to do. It brought us to a nice marina next to the boat launch site. A short walk down from this was a great little beach area which gave views all the way to Auckland, again the sun was shining and it couldn't be much better for our first night in the van.

The next day we decided we were going to the far point of the headland which was a nature reserve with War World history tied to it. We took a great walk round the dense forest land and came out onto a great lookout point just above a local farm (no sheep have been seen up to this point). It gave us 360 view all around the coast line which resembled the undulating coast line of Cornwall, albeit made from different materials and the beautiful blue sky reflecting down on the water. After this we tried to get into the Kiwi spirit chilling by the beach for a few hours, which ended up being a bad idea. Now we're both red like crabs, cursing the hole in the ozone layer above us.

We decided to stay at the same site again as we were in no rush to get moving. When we arrived back it was funny to see the same old faces occupying the camper spaces, along with our weird new friend "trousers too low, t-shirt too high issue". 

Waking up, we found that it was a little cooler than the night before, but the sun soon rose and our skin was shouting for forgiveness. We took it easy again, popping for a coffee then dropping by a market all with the end goal of ours friends in sight. We went for a swim at a new beach and had a little walk round a old house from 1870's. It seemed like a popular place for the locals, so I believe that means it was a good choice by us. 

Next week we're going to be heading further north. We have been warned of the vast amount of beach's. Not something I planned on seeing much of, but that's what this area has go offer. We'll travel up to the most northerly tip where apparently winter never falls and see some of the land and towns of the first European settlers.
