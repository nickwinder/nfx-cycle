We ended up taking the trip down the south Island to get work in the Queenstown area. This region has many Vineyards and therefore lots of work at grape picking time. Through my contact, we managed to get some picking jobs starting this week, so we can finally make a little bit of money back.

The trip down wasn't too bad, after all this country isn't really that big. We arrived in Picton where the ferry dropped us off and we set off for Christchurch almost right away. After food and a few pictures.

We headed for a cheap campsite, rather than a free campsite as we needed a shower. We decided that 9 days without a hot shower is pretty horrible. Along the way we saw some seals off the east coast and had some fish and chips! Still gotta say, kiwis still don't know how to make chips, but the fish was pretty good.

The next day saw us into the mountains, if the weather would have been goof enough we would have seen Mt. Cook, but sadly the cloud was hanging over the tallest peak. Still the views were sublime.

The wineyard is in a place called Bannockburn, just outside the town of Cromwell. It's a nice valley with Vineyards and Fruit fields everywhere. The area has been inhabited for a fair while due to the gold mining originally and then the perfect growing weather at the present time.

We've had our first few days of work, which ends up being case of, quick quick, snip snip, check check, next bunch. Not the hardest work in the world, but no time to rest also, although a great snack is put on for us at morning break, they call this smoko, which I'm guessing was originally a cigarette break.

Sadly the wet weather is upon us right now, so this means no picking and no money. But it has given us a break over the Easter weekend. We went and did a 10km Trail run on Friday, where I came second with a time of 39:50. Pretty happy has it was tough in sections. Although this now means I'm hobbling with foot troubles. Injured as always!
