As I said in the last post we were heading to a Work Away place to find a bit of shelter.  Little did we know it was going to be a weird experience.

We headed to a little run down house in a place called Tuatapere. This was a small little village with not much going on, but we were promised a nice organic garden to work on and yoga classes throughout the week.  So as we pulled up to a run down house it was a little bit unexpected.

We found out that the place we were promised was next door and the guy used to work with them up until a week ago.  This was all a bit strange and the scuttling of rats in the roof just added to the charm.  On the first night the guy decided to show us his freestyle rap out of the blue. This is when we started wondering how we were going to get through the week.

The next day we got to work. I was chopping wood and Ashley had the delights of cleaning the house. But all this came after the morning yoga at 7am. It wasn't too bad, but a little mentally intense for our liking, apparently we are used to western yoga.
More delights came later in the day in form of his two children.  They were absolutely mental, demanding head wrestling and destroying the place. It was Day 2 , and we got through it.

Day 3 went fairly well without any real dramas, but then came day 4. We started with yoga again, but this soon turned into meditation. An hour long meditation! Safe to say I was wanting to run away and Ashley fell asleep. I understand why people may do it, but I do not want him to be talking through it for 1 hour solid.

Thankfully we were heading off the next day to watch a 60km running race on one of the great walking tracks. A couple of our friends were running from queenstown, so we went along to calm nerves, cheer on and support in anyway we could. It was a great event with some crazy achievements topped off with a BBQ to end the night. Fun all round and it topped off the weekend quite nicely.

Next week we will finally be leaving the queenstown area, but not before we round the 31 km Routeburn track!
