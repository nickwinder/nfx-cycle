This morning seems like so long ago. It was a long day on the bike. With 1300m of accent and all that luggage!I'm not surprised. 

So I started out the day deciding that I was going to do 2 short days followed by a longer one into Kiruna. So I set off at a leisurely pace, and I hit a few hills. It was nice, it made a change to the rolling sea roads. It made for some rewarding bike and amazing views drop up and over Narvik. 
So you knew there was going to be a but.... I got to the campsite and the women said they don't take tents. Apparently thats normal in Norway? She said the next campsite is 40km over Sweden way. I should have stopped there and called it a day, but I got it in my head that I want that shower and a normal toilet. So I went for it.

There were bigggg hills (OK I can call them mountains now. I assume it would be like normal moutains and you go up and come down the other side, that's not the case here. There's an amazing kinda undulating plateau at the top that goes on for ever. And the landscape changes with it. From smoothly carved rock, to sharp river shattered rock.

So that campsite ended up being just over 50km away, she was nearly right. Just didn't tell me about the massive mountains. The campsite wanted to charge 300kr, some stupid membership or something. I politely said no to that, but than she did offer the use of facilities for 50kr. Seen as that's what I went there for I jumped at the chance. 

So now I'm nice and clean, slightly tanned and bitten all over. Welcome to Sweden.
