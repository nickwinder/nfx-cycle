Usually on a rest day I bundle the update into the next riding day, but there was a fair bit going on, so this is purely about the day in Tampere.

Today I spent the day in Tampere, an attempted rest day.

Having looked around the city, I'm pretty impressed. Its a really nice city with a industrial history. With the nickname the "Manchester of Finland" and then also mixing that with a quote for Alan partridge "ermmmm cotton and guns" you get the gist what the cities about. Minus the guns.

It was certainly a surprise to see so much brickwork in Finland, these buildings were mainly focused around the old factory areas wedged between 2 huge lakes that it is situated on, and the whole reason why the city is there. Sadly all the museums were closed as it was monday, so I can't tell you too much more about the place apart from.

I made it over to a preservation area which is set slightly higher than the city. Right at the top of this hill is a cafe and observatory tower giving great views over the whole city and the surrounding landscape. I was told by many locals about the doughnuts that this cafe sold, and now I can understand why,Ã‚  not bad. Not bad at all.

I managed to get to a bike shop who fixed my rack within 20 minutes. This was a huge relief, but he was apprehensive in saying its a permanent fix. It seems that the rack is struggling with the huge loads. It seems a bit of weird design, although I think this is a resultant of having the disc brakes sticking out from the frame. Anyway, I'm going to try and pack the rear a little lighter and go careful. I'll take a check in Helsinki again.
