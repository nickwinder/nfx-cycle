Short/rest day today. I was going to spend 2 nights on the campsite but I couldn't justify the 18 euro price tag. I did stick around as long as possible to get my moneys worth though. 

I had a quick potter into the town centre. One shopping centre looking over IKEA. That's about it. So I decided just to get on the bike and go super easy, to see where it got me. 
I got to Kemi, which is the next little city up here. Yet again it didn't seem like it had much going for it, a couple of small shops and a station. The promenade was nice but it reminded me of Hornsea too much. There was a campsite near the city centre, so I decided to see if it was any cheaper than the night before. I got there and everything was closed up. I found a sign that said '31/08', I assume that means end of the season. At first I thought great a whole campsite to myself, so I went on search of food. I went back to the campsite to find the local youth hot spot seemed to be the small road ending next to the site, I made the quick decision that I did not want to compete with them all night, so I scarped.

Now I find my self in the woods just of the roadside. Nothing fancy, there's also a weird stench of rotting fish. I thought it was that was a Swedish delicacy? I'm sure my nose will get used to it. 

P.S I moved again because I could hear far too many mice for my liking.
