We didn't pick the best week to continue our travels. We were hounded by rain, hail and crazy winds. We still tried to find things we could do despite the weather though. Our first day was mainly travelling over to the east coast towards Dunedin and Oamaru, but along the way we decided to make a quick stop off in Clyde to see the dam that was install which flooded a huge area around Cromwell. The rest was mainly driving through deserted roads which felt so odd considering we'd been in busy Queenstown for the previous 8 months.

We headed to Oamaru which has a small historic centre and a strange fascination with steam punk. Walking around there was huge steam punk models rather than the statues you'd normally see. It just seemed like the town was trying to find a new identity from there past of exporting goods like wool.
I know the picture below is not steam punk, But I'd never been on a penny farthing.

Next up was Dunedin. Dunedin felt strangely familiar due to it's strong links to Scotland. Lots of architecture was similar to houses back in the UK, although most were converted into a student housing hosting a huge student population. We headed round the museums learning the interesting history of Dunedin and generally found things to do.
This is the steepest residential street in NZ.

The rain lightened slightly which allowed us to get moving again. We headed done in the the Catlins which was much greener than the areas we had come from. Understandable considering the amount of rain we were having. We headed to a light house to see the cliffs and to see some crazy seals having a fight and moved on down the road to the next place. At this point the car started playing up again! I had a quick look under the car and found that the inside of the drivers tyre was stripped to the carcass. We have no idea how this happened but it's the last thing we wanted. We limped to the nearest sleepy garage and the guy said he could fit us in. Lucky seen as it was Friday afternoon and I'm sure they wanted to get home. As an extra thanks we headed back with a 6 pack of beers for them, and as soon as I pulled them out they invited us to drink with them (they already had a 24 pack). It seems like this is the thing to do in a small town like this. Head to the garage with your beer and hang out. All nice and fun, they pointed us to a nice camp spot by the coast and we had a windy nights sleep.

We headed out for a small run in the morning which was cut short by pains in my ankle, but we only had more driving on the schedule anyway. Just a few more spots hit before Invercargill. The only reason for heading to Invercargill was to head for a shower. We'd got a tip that there was a $1 shower! A bargain round here and just what we needed after 6 days of grime had built up on us.


It was Invercargill that we decided that we needed to get inside. The weather was really turning and even driving was a bit scary. We got in touch with a few Work Away hosts and kept our fingers crossed. Lucky for us one replied and we had a spot for the next day. One more sleep and we'd have a bit of cover.
