Another group turned up over night. Who knows when and how they got here, but its not the quiet place I had yesterday. So I had a lazy morning and set off at 11am. 
I didn't want to got far, so I spotted a fire hut around 30km on, with the route passing back through Ruovesi so I could pick up some supplies. 

A couple of things made me laugh today. One being the woodpeckers. First, I didn't realise how colourful they were. But the funny part was this morning. It had still been bombarding me with acorns, and one of them he managed to throw an acorn from a height straight into a water bucket. Now if that was on YouTube. The kids would go crazy. But it was just me, so I giggled to myself instead. 

I'm now at the other fire hut, which was a trek to get to. I had to get off my bike and walk up a hill for the first time this trip and then scramble through a few fields to get to this one. Not sure where I'm going to put my tent, but its nice and quiet again. Apart from Mr woodpeckers mates are here. I bet they are planning something.
