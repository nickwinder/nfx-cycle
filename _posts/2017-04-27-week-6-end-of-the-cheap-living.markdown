This is pretty much our final week in South East Asia, we'll be up in Ha long bay then traveling down to Da Nang where Ashley's friends are currently teaching. So first we took the journey over from Hanoi to Cat Ba island. This is a famous tourist site renowned for it's natural beauty. We had a bus, a boat and another bus to catch, after being a little late it was all surprisingly easy for Vietnam. It as great to get onto the island. I feel it had been so long since we had seen any spectacular scenery. The peaks where very pronounced full with tree coverage, we zig zagged over the hills all the way to the east side of the island.

We only had two full days on the island so we had to make full use of them. So we booked a boat tour to take us around the waters surrounding the island. The boats route out was through the floating villages wedged between the big cliff faces. It seems this whole village was based around fishing of some type, some having little fish farms and some with big trawlers. Also every single household had dogs. I can only assume for protection, but I really don't understand against what as it would have been pretty hard to sneak onto someones floating house. They were pretty fierce when you floated past. We spent a few hours floating through the waters and ended up at a floating house for lunch, but first we had a chance to go kayaking out on the water. This was a great way of seeing the area as it was so peaceful, and it wasn't even very busy. We were in an area called Lan ha, just shy of Ha Long bay. We'd been told that it was a better place to visit as the crowds in Ha Long can get stupid, with hundreds of boats filling the waters of that area. Going to Lan Ha instead was well worth it to gain relative remoteness. The food offered by the floating restaurant was actually a pretty good spread, although strangely no fish. There was little fish farms all around the out side of the deck and one guy lifted the middle of the deck to show us the big mummy fish which they bread from. It was huge, and just static. She didn't have much room to swim around down there so I assume she just waited for food all day. The boat took us out a little further out to a little beach to have a swim. We were all a little apprehensive about this as there as floating rubbish every where. It's frustrating to see places like this ruined by no disposable rubbish, and by the amount that was in the water we can only assume it comes from the floating villages. Because of this we didn't really want to jump in the water, but in the end we took our chances and went for it. Surprisingly it was pretty cold, even in the blazing sun. We'd been out all day and the journey back was a long way. The boat wasn't the fastest vessel in the world, still we just made it back for sun down. The sunset was beautiful across the waters.

After an eventful first day, sadly I had to get a lot of work done so I left the rest of them to go and explore the island. Apparently they went out to the national park on the island for a walk. The pictures of the views from the top were very cool, with super pointy peaks and a huge amount of greenery.

The next day we had a fair bit of traveling to do as we were transiting to Da Nang. We had to go via Hanoi and grab a flight from there, so it meant that we took the bus, boat, bus combo again. Although this time it didn't quite go as smoothly. One of the buses had over booked, so we got lumped onto a packed bus with bags shoved up against us. The guy in front was cheated out of his money, as the ticket he'd been sold apparently wasn't valid and money changed hands between the driver and organiser for some girls passport. The bribery and dishonesty really spoils the place and taints the experience of the whole place. We got to Da Nang late evening, although you wouldn't know it because the place was so lit up. It was like being in Japan again. It was quite a drastic change for the places up north. You can really see why there is more ex-pats here.

We had a few days here and we had some interesting things planned, probably because we had our very own tour guide in Ashley's friends. This was also the first place I would be driving a moped on these crazy streets. The attractions were mainly the beach areas and mountains in the surrounding areas, so the moped was a necessity. One of the day trips we took was to a national park north of the city. This was a mountain in which the French settled on for the cooler climate in the altitude, annoyingly we hit some really bad weather heading over the pass and it continued into the next valley. It's probably the hairiest driving I've even done, the visibility was so poor and the rain was showing up the oil patches on the road. We saw two bikes that had accidents on the way down, one of which slide out when trying to pass our friends. It was pretty scary to say the least, but we all made it out alive! We headed back over the pass to find nicer weather and a water hole/swimming area to cool off. The place we found was pretty cool, we rented a little gazebo at the side of the river which they had dammed and relaxed there for a good part of the day. Most of the other people there were Vietnamese teens partying as hard as teens can do without drink involved. It was pretty funny.

Another day we also traveled further south to a place called Hoi an. This was a cute little old town, with plenty of tourist attractions. We walked around the night markets, which were lined with lanterns everywhere, this place was also known for it's custom tailoring and handmade products which all looked pretty good, but they probably bumped in price for the tourists.

Other than the two day trips, we mainly hung around the beach and ate cheap food for the last time. It's going to be a big shock coming back to the UK and not being able to nip out for a quick cheap meal. Although you do have the added bonus of knowing you probably won't get sick in the UK.

All in all it's been interesting in South East Asia. We've seen a lot of things that have opened our eyes and cultures that are drastically different to ours. I wouldn't say I'd rush back soon, but I'd certainly suggest people should experience it.

Next stop. England.
