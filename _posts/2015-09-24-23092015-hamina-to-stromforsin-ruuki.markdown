I'm starting to feel a little ill at the moment and I'm worried that I'm not getting enough fruit and veg down me. So I went to the store and bought lots of veg to try and rustle something up. It cost a bit much, but it was really nice to have something different from rice and beans.

I got to Kotka hoping it was going to be a nice place to hang around and have a coffee. I was wrong. What a waste of a location! The buildings were horrible and it was industrial on the coast line! It was a 10km I wish I never took. I was starting to think that these coastal towns are a waste of time.

I followed the cycle route slightly inland, riding on pretty small dirt tracks which were quiet. This was great to relax again and listen to a quick podcast. I then came across a small village, it seemed very pretty and unlike others that I had seen on the way. I later found out it was a historical sight which had been preserved.

From the village it was a short ride out to a beautiful spot for a Laavu, sitting up high above the lake. It was an amazing sun set again and I got some great pictures. The Laavu did have a huge sign on it though. No camping! This was strange, but because of this I set up tent a little further away. Which is probably a good thing because I heard someone banging around in the Laavu later. That could have got awkward.
