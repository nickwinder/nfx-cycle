Pretty much a rest day today, even though the camp site wasn't the best it was still really good to just start everything slowly. 

All the berry pickers who were stating on the site got up super early, it was around 6:30am, so at that point I was awake. I had a bit of breakfast and popped off to the shops. This was the one and only time where I'd be able to cook some real vegetables! It was great, even though it was just fried veg, it beat noddles or cous cous again.

I've been back and forth with the bike charger manufacturer but it doesn't seem I'm getting anywhere. So I'm going have to put it down to a bad investment. There is a shop in Helsinki which sell a different type, so I'm going to give that a try. 
This means I cannot rely on having battery all the time so I'm having to plan alternative things to do in the evening. So I'm already reading, but I've got a notepad now. Let's see what happens with that

I set off for the spot I wanted to call base camp for a few nights.Â  Only around 15km away, but down some really beaten up tracks. In the end it turned into a footpath, which was OK. But then it turn into a obstacle course. So I had to do the last 500 metres in rounds. Take all my bags down then carry the bike down. Safe to say, I'm not getting out of here in a rush.

It's really nice spot, but there's already 2 groups here. One a school trip from Holland, let's hope they're too tired from all the walking, and 2 girls from Finland. So I decided to camp there side of the site to get to know the locals. They've gone for a walk already......... :) I hardly even said anything.
