So that's it, my last day of riding in the Baltic countries. 

If there was any thought in my mind thinking that I could carry on, it was wiped this morning. Up at 4am, trying to stay warm in a tent is not fun. I started riding with 4 layers on top and bottom and barely being able to squeeze the brakes.

The ride wasn't so long today, and it felt like RÄ«ga was the finish line for me, just longing for it to get closer and closer. But I kept telling myself to enjoy the day.

Enjoy the day ....... So, if you ever questioned why I'm not a big fan of dogs, come and ride in Latvia with me. During the first hour I was chased three times, only one was pretty close, the other two seemed too old. Yes I understand the reason why they chase bikes excuse, because they see you as prey, but how does that help me. I still get chomped at. 

Other than that the frost gave some beautiful views, and Ashley if this is what people mean when they say autumn (fall) is a beautiful time of year, I take my words back.

When I arrived in RÄ«ga I spotted a nice looking bike shop, so I stopped to ask about bike boxes to get my bike on the plane and hostel advice. Hostel advice because my warm showers host let me down, I had no communication after saying yes its fine. The guy in the shop was super helpful and found us a half decent hostel and told me to head back later for a bike box. 

I got to the hostel and all the dooms were booked up, but she offer the private room for â‚¬15 , how could I say no to that. I paid more for a campsite in Finland! I got in, booked a flight for Saturday and extended my stay at the hostel for 2 more night for the same price. 

I'm kinda happy and sad now. Happy that I don't have to be in the cold. Sad because I know I wanted to go further. But I realised it would only have been a ego thing, being able to say I went x far. If you asked me what I saw, it would be nothing but roads. I'm going to spend my last few days in RÄ«ga, and see what the place has to offer.
