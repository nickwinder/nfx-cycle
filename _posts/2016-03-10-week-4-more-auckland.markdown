This week mainly consisted of visiting people. So we said we knew nobody in New Zealand when we came here, but that is plainly not true.

We had our last day on the avocado orchard and set off back to meet my friends. Just a quick over night visit to pick up our IRD numbers (now we can work legally!) , then on the road again.

Piha was the destination in mind. It is a surf town about 1 hour from Auckland, famous for its waves and spectacular coast line. Sadly we couldn't see much of it when we got there as there was low cloud and rain. But we were determined go see the place. It's situated in small bay in which you drop into abruptly. Upon approaching the beach you can certainly tell why it's popular for the surfers. The waves are crazy.

Having nowhere to stay and no free campsite near by, we decided to chance it at the beach car park. Its pretty much out of season now so all was pretty quiet. We did wake up watching the morning surfers with their girly hair. 
We headed for a small walk to a water fall in the morning, then set off to Auckland.

Ashley's uncle was on a cruise ship heading for Auckland on the Friday. It seemed like a great opportunity to catch up in foreign lands. This did mean we had 3 nights to spend in Auckland, and the cheap skates we are , we search for people we knew in Auckland. It was pretty good, because I got to see a friend from Whistler (4-5 years ago!), and we also stayed with one of Ashley's friends.

During the time in Auckland we went on a museum tour with the Maori guy we stayed with at the start of our trip. This was one of the best tours I think we could have done. He had amazing knowledge of all aspects of the life and history of his people and he also got us in on the cheap. :)

On the down side, we had the car looked at because we'd started to suss out the problems it had. This turned up more problems and safe to say we are out of pocket a little. But hopefully with a more reliable van.

We had a good day with Ashley's uncle, going to the Auckland art gallery, Parnell , and generally spending some good time with them.

Now we're ready to leave and travel south! Some big mountains on the way! Next week we are travelling down go New Plymouth, which sits right next to a quiescent stratovolcano (I don't know what that means). But it is one we can hopefully climb.
