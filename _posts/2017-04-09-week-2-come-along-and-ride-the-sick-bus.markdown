We started our week by making the 3ish hour journey up to a northern town called Pai.  I say ish, because this is highly dependant drivers scale of crazy driving. It's a common game to count down the 762 corners to Pai, but after the first few you are just ensuring that you are still on your own seat and also keeping the sick down.  Ashley was in the back, which was much worse, you could tell by her face when she got out.  Anyway our Thai version of Lewis Hamilton got us to Pai in under 3 hours, which I'm sure is a record, so he'll be happy.  We made it alive.

Once we got into Pai, it was so strange to see an abundance of westerners.  This was obviously the place to come and relax in the sweltering sun with a beer in hand and a fruit shake in the other.  The hotel we booked into was really good.  Each room was an individual bungalow made from wood and bamboo, all centred round a nice little garden, a nice little paradise next to the market which resembled Primark.  We wondered round that night and got some great cheap food and booked a tour for the next day.

Our tour consisted of all the popular things to do in the area.  This time the driver was a little better giving us time to look out into the vast jungle like landscape.  Although you can only see so far, the haze here is unbelievable.  As we are in the burn season, there is not much rainfall to stop dust and pollution from swirling around in the air. It's really sad, because I can only imagine the scenery that this place could have.  We headed 2 hours out of pai to a cave system nearer the Myanmar (Burmese) border.  Sadly we didn't take our cameras as we were told water was involved, but I'll explain as best I can.  We walked into entrance of the cave which opened out into a huge 20m high, bat infested...... cave. We were lead through by local guides with kerosene lanterns.  The only English that came out of their mouths was accompanied with them pointing at some formation to say "Crocodile", "Dogs" and even "Boob".  It added a slight comedic element to the tour that wouldn't get on your own. We walked around different passage ways for a while and then headed down to get on a bamboo raft which would take us further through the system to another opening.  It was just amazing the amount of large fish in the water, I just could believe that no one had a fishing rod out and caught their dinner. Travelling through these cathedral like caves with small specks of light coming from the lanterns at the front of 10 or so rafts created an amazing atmosphere. Super quiet, fish bobbing around you, the high pitch sound of bats became louder and louder as we moved towards another exit. We walk further round this area before we headed back on the rafts to exit the caves.
From the caves we had a quick bite to eat and then it was back on the bus to head to some hot springs.  Not really what you need in this hot weather but a unique experience anyway. The water was just warm, kind of like bath water seconds. The local school seemed to be there also, which added to the chaotic atmosphere.
We still had more to see on this tour! For only 500 baht (20 NZD, 11 pounds) it was real bargain. We went to see a big white buddha sat up on the hill above Pai and then on to watch the sunset out at Pai Canyon.  This crazy formation formed over thousand of years has plenty of shear cliff drops with narrow ridge lines to jump across. We headed far out straight away to find a little more secluded area to watch the sun set. A great way to end the day.

After fitting nearly everything to do in Pai into one day, we decided we'd earnt a few rest days. We mainly pottered around the village for a few days eating good food, and walking as slowly as possible.  We did book on to a cookery class though, it was just us two in the class so we had the chef, Gaoi, all to our selves.  We made around 5 different dishes, from sweet mango sticky rice to the famous Pad Thai. She also took us to the local markets to explain some of the local produce and get us tasting the things we'd never dared to try. Luckily we told her we're vegetarian as there was plenty of weird fried insects. We had the nice things like banana rice and cold fruit juices. All in all, it was a good experience, I don't think we learnt much about cooking the food, but we certainly got a good feed.

The next day we caught the bus back to Chiang Mai.  This time we went for an apartment complex further out of town. We thought we'd try and live a little more luxurious whilst it was cheap.  The complex had a pool, sauna and a gym, so we were ready to make good use of that.  But the down side was being so far from the city. We had to catch a taxi every time we wanted to go into town, and there was also nothing round us at all.

The next couple of days, we enjoyed the western culture that has invaded Chiang Mai.  We had coffee at a coffee shop which had come 5th in the World Latte Championships and rushed into big shopping malls to keep cool.  This side of town was a drastic difference from hundreds of stalls lining the streets on the east side of town.

During the weekend, the major road running through the centre is always closed for the weekend night markets. The stalls line the streets for around 1.5km, with food, clothes and hill tribe jewelry.  It's really different and step up from the standard tatty night market. It's really great being able to walk down the street relatively traffic free. I say relatively because some one always manages to get there moped through somehow.

That's all here. We are going to be moving on to Chiang Rai, nearer the Loas and Myanmar boarder. Hopefully this will bring some different scenery and good times.
