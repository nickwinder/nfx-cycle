The main aim of today was to stay dry. It was forecast light rain all day, and up to now the weatherman is completely right. It's that wet rain that England has, soaks ya right through. 

I headed for the nearest town to go and find some indoor space I could occupy for a number of hours. I found a coffee shop to get my caffeine fix and the train station. Yes.... I sat in the train station for an hour. That's how much I didn't want to get wet. The town I was in was Kuokola. It didn't seem to have much going for it though, more alcoholics than I've seen in other towns and a poor selection of things to see. I.E nothing. But if you ever need a train to St Petersburg, I can tell you where to go. 

Other than that, all I wanted was a quiet Laavu for tonight. I tried just outside a village just south of Kuokola, but it looked a bit unloved. So I kept going for the next one which is situated right next to the Kymiyoki river. It's quiet, with only one farm in sight, I'll have to get inventive with the tent and I'm sure I'll have some pictures for you in the morning.
