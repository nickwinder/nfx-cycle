Another rest day yesterday and it was quite a interesting one. The ride today was not quite as interesting and wet again..... Oooo dear. Let's hope I don't have too much of that. 

For the rest day I was still with the WS host. His wife cooked up some porridge with some local fresh blueberries. Super nice and it beats my camp stove version.

For today he decided to take me on his little boat out to sea and around the islands. It was a super great experience and I got to drive for a bit. Basically watch out for rocks. We went out to two little wooden cottages, which are maintained by the forestry agency. They are unbelievably good, they have a little wood burning stove , 2 bunk beds and all the wood you could ever need. You can see people use them and keep them in very good condition. I really wish I had time to stay a night, as the view out to sea would be great at sun set.

When we got home I could smell the aromas of lasagne. Home cooked with no mushrooms, yet again luxury. I've really been spoilt. I had 2nd and 3rd helpings, just to try and get as much inside me as possible. Lots of conversation, vodka, beer and sauna was had. It was all great. 

I set off today at around 10, straight away I could tell the rest helped so much. I felt.... kinda fresh. Even though the rain was coming down, it didn't matter, I just kept on ploughing on. 

The most successful thing today was purchasing dinner. I jumped into a little cafeteria next to the petrol station and start to copy the person in front of me. Bit of salad, cottage cheese, pastry things and egg. Grabbed a coffee cup and head to the till. It came up as â‚¬4, and I was like 'ha what about the rest' , but no all I had to pay for was the pastry and coffee. I couldn't believe my luck and ran away quickly. I really need to find one of these places again and work out what I can get away with.

I've just arrived in Jakobstad at another WS hosts. Yeah its a little cheeky to do 2 in a row but there is none until Turku now, so I'll take them where I can. All seems nice, just gotta dodge the cats every now and then.
