As a lot of you know. I've headed over to New Zealand with Ashley. This blog seemed to work well to update you all of my goings on when cycling. So I've decided to keep it up in New Zealand, also instead of the daily updates, I'm going to keep it to weekly updates.

Just so you know, we are planning on buying a campervan and travelling around the north and south island. Doing a little bit of work along the way to keep our funds going. At the current time I have no real idea what I want to see in NZ, but I'm sure they'll be plenty of exciting experiences along the way.
