Today was my first running day. I decided before I set out on this trip I wanted to do a bit of trail running in different places. But before now I was a little worried my legs were too fatigued to run.

Judging by the trail getting into to this camping spot I knew it was going to be a tough one. I was right, it was really good running, but you had to be on your toes at all times. Slippy tree roots and rocks everywhere, add that to all the board walks on the trail, it made for a exciting run. 

I only did 11km, but it felt more like 20km. Running back on the fire track was even tough. So I now know that my legs were no were near recovered. Plus its hard running on the trails in Finland. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

For the rest of the day, I've been enjoying the peace and quiet. Everyone who camped here last night had moved on. So all I can here now is the calling of weird birds and the woodpecker attempting to knock a tree down. If only you could find this spot anywhere in the world.

A later note, 3 other couples turned up tonight. I was chatting to one about Helsinki as that's where they were from. But I'm guessing tomorrow is going to be even more busy. So I've decided to move on down towards Tampere tomorrow.
