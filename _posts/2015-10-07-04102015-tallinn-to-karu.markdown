After a early wake up call to say goodbye to Ashley, it was time to get back on the road. I've got a better plan of where I am going now and it seems the weather will push me to ride longer days. Next week there is supposed to be lows of 2 Celsius in Tallinn so I need to get as far south as possible and quick. Looking in central Poland the temperatures seem lower than on the northern coast. This seems to work better with my route anyway, so I'll hug that coast all the way to Germany. Only then will I drop south a little more before getting into France. That's the general plan, but this all depends in how I survive this cold blast. 

For the first day I wanted to make the ride as painless as possible. I headed to the shop early morning to stock up and ate a large breakfast to keep me going. I headed out just before 11 with the intention of going to the really nice coffee shop before I left Tallinn. But its Sunday and it was closed, so I went caffineless again. 

It took a fair while to get out of Tallinn, there is lots of residential areas to the south of the city and some with more money than others. There seems to be a fair disparity between the rich and the poor. The still living in the run down soviet era flats and the rich seem to be living in the custom new build areas. It's a shame to see that the independence has not benefited all. 

The landscape is very flat here with a mix of forests and farm land. The forests have been left fairly untouched, I haven't seen much signs of logging at all. Which does mean its going to be hard to find a camping spot in the woods as they are so overgrown.

I've only one more day in Estonia then it's onto Latvia. I'll play spot the difference and see if I do any good.
